Binary Adder
By David Buckingham, with size optimization by Mark
Niemec, 1975.  Two glider streams enter the lower
right, representing the binary numbers 1110 and 0011.
The sum, 10001, appears from the middle right side
after about one thousand generations. The gliders go
in and come out backwards -- that is, 1's place first.
That way, the numbers to be added can be arbitrarily
large.
