<H1>New c/5 spaceship</H1>
Over a year ago, when this web page was
just starting up, Tim Coe found 
<A HREF="../p5ss.html">the first c/5 orthogonal spaceship</A>,
appropriately dubbed "the snail" by David Griffeath in his
<A HREF="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/kitchen.html">Primordial
Soup Kitchen</A>.
David Bell has now found a much smaller c/5.
Though it lacks the biological synchronicity of Coe's
discovery, it makes up for this
with some useful sparks.

<EM>Subject: New period 5 c/5 spaceship with sparks</EM><BR>

<P>
Today I found a new reasonably small period 5 c/5 spaceship:
<P>
<A HREF="pic1.html"><IMG SRC="pic1.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>


The spaceship is short and symmetrical with an empty column between them.
Only in one phase do the two halves react with each other, and that is just
to suppress a cell.  It turns out that the edge of the spaceship can also
do this suppression, and so a flipped copy of the component will also work.
But you then need to terminate THAT component, however.  You can continue
this arbitrarily often, but finally need the end component to finish it.
An example of this is the following:

This ship has some nice sparks at the edges and back.  So you would expect
that it might do nice things to gliders, blocks, and other stuff.  It can
at least do a little bit.  Here is a reaction in which a glider is turned
into a block by one c/5 ship, and then is deleted by a second one:

<A HREF="rle2.html"><IMG SRC="rle2.gif"></A>
<P>


But I didn't find any other useful reactions with gliders, other than
deleting them.  (There are lots of ways to do that.)  The hope of making
a new glider and thus making a puffer out of this isn't realized.
I even tried a little bit using two of the spaceships to perturb a glider.
This can be done in a few different ways, but I still found nothing useful.
Anyone else have better luck?
<P>
Finally, the block deleting feature of the spaceship allows us to construct
a new type of growing spaceship.  Here a c/3 period 24 block puffer has
its output consumed by the c/5 spaceship.  The line of blocks grows
longer and longer:

<P>


My motivation for finding this spaceship is the realization that gliders
can approach a c/5 ship from the back.  This means that gliders don't have
to react at the sides, but can react anywhere along the back edge.
So instead of trying to find long and thin spaceships, it seems better
to find short and wide ones.  With enough of a grammar built up, some
back edge might be found which will perturb an incoming glider correctly
to produce another one (plus junk, probably).
<P>
By the way, my recent success in finding objects has come about because
of a certain circumstance at work.  I happen to have five Pentimum 150's
available full time for at least the medium term, and so I can do five
different searches at the same time!  I have also fixed a long term bug
in my lifesrc program in which cells to be ignored did the wrong thing
for other generations.
