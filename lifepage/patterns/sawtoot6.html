Diagonal sawtooth with expansion factor 4
Population is unbounded but does not tend to infinity.  Its graph
is a sawtooth function with ever-increasing teeth.

A p960 gun sends gliders southwest.  Some are deleted; the others
reflect off the back of a Cordership.  Each returning glider
deletes 2 outgoing ones.

Note the use of an in-line inverter found by David Bell.
