p30 glider gun (the Original)
This is made of two of a pattern
know as the "queen bee", which
sometimes occurs naturally,
whose debris can be deleted on 
the sides by blocks or eaters.
But a collision in the center
can, as seen here, miraculously 
form a glider. Just one of these
moving back and forth is called
piston (see the p30 in OSCSPN2).
