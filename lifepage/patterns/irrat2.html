Irrational 2
Population growth appears to be linear with an irrational multiplier.
The probability that a MWSS will hit a boat seems to be  1/sqrt(2)
for the lower (westward) stream, and  sqrt(2)-1  for the upper
(eastward) stream.  If this is true, then the population in gen t is
about  (78 sqrt(2) - 73)t/40  for t even, and (82 sqrt(2) - 77)t/40
for t odd.  If you can prove any of this, please let me know.
