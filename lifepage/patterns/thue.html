Thue generator
Four puffers produce gliders, whose collisions produce four
lines of blinkers representing the transcendental number
.110110111110110111110110110..., where the n'th bit is 1 if n
is not divisible by 3 and is the complement of the (n/3)'th bit
if n is divisible by 3.
Built by Bill Gosper, in or before 1987
