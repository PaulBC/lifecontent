Glider synthesis for a hustler
123 gliders crash to form the period 3 oscillator "hustler".  First,
14 gliders are used to form the p8 Hertz oscillator, with non-standard
induction coils.  The induction coils are then repeatedly modified by
the next 99 gliders.  Finally, 10 gliders are used to reshape the
billiard table and induction coils, creating the hustler.
The steps of the construction were figured out by David Buckingham.
Dean Hickerson put them together, about 3/12/91, from notes by
Buckingham dated 1/30/90.
