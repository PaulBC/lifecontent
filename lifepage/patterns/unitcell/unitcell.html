Here are some approximate generation numbers for important events which
occur during the 5760 generations which make up one Generation.  Some of
these events only occur if the Cell is LIVE.
<PRE>
0:      Current state glider starts from pair of long boats
400:    Current state glider arrives at fanout device
600:    Output gliders escape from the fanout device
900:    Missing LWSS turned into boat to hold Cell's current state
1800:   First glider arrives at the glider detector to be turned into a block
4000:   Last glider arrives at the glider detector to be turned into a block
        and the high period glider guns fire
4700:   Stream of 10 gliders starts sweep through glider detector to count
        the number of blocks in the detector
5200:   Gliders from stream react in the Life Logic circuit to calculate
        the new current state glider
5700:   New current state glider arrives back at the pair of long boats
