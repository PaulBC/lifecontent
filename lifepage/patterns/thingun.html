4-bit binary counter
A p736 (= 46 * 2^4) gun based on 4 boat-bits which form a binary
counter.  (A boat-bit is a memory device in which a bit of
information is represented as the presence or absence of a boat
adjacent to a snake (or eater or beacon or ...).  Hitting the
boat-bit with a glider changes its state.  The transition from
1 to 0 can be detected by another glider.)
