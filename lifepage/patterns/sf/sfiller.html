<TITLE>Coe's improvements on the spacefiller</TITLE>
<H1>Spacefillers and other fast-growing patterns</H1>
The spacefiller is the fastest growing pattern known
in Conway's Life.  It rapidly fills the plane to a density of
1/2 with live cells; this is conjectured to be the highest possible
density.  The first spacefiller was designed in 1993
after the necessary components were found using a computer search.
An example of <A HREF="../max.html">a spacefiller</A>
is provided in the pattern archive.
<P>
Before the discovery of the spacefiller,
the fastest growth rates were attained using some
variation of the <EM>breeder</EM>, 
which achieves quadratic growth by "breeding" linear-growth
patterns such as glider guns at a linear rate.
The
<A HREF="../breeder.html">classic breeder</A> was
the first example of such a pattern. 
A <A HREF="../breeder2.html">much smaller breeder</A> has
since been designed, and variations on this
theme have been developed, such as the 
<A HREF="../rakegun.html">rake gun</A> and the
<A HREF="../switcpuf.html">switch engine puffer</A>.
<P>
Like the breeder, the spacefiller grows at a quadratic rate,
which is easily seen to be the fastest attainable.
However, the constant factor is much higher
for the spacefiller.  In addition, 
the spacefiller represents a conceptual leap in that it 
tiles the plane with a regular, stable pattern rather than
a collection of discrete objects.
<P>
It is interesting to try to determine just how large
a Life pattern needs to be before it can 
exhibit an explosive, quadratic rate of growth.
The first spacefillers were already
much smaller than any known breeders.
Tim Coe has recently refined the known size bounds,
and developed new spacefillers with other
properties as well.

During the course of my searches for various types of
space ships I ran across a fair number of c/2 ships that
could act as spacefiller stretchers.  Here are some of
the resulting spacefillers I have managed to construct:
<P>
  A 187 point spacefiller that fits in a 27 by 27 box.<P>
<A HREF="pic1.html"><IMG SRC="pic1.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>

  A 189 point 2 cycle predecessor to David Bell's  206 point construction.<P>
<A HREF="pic2.html"><IMG SRC="pic2.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>

  A 187 point rotationally symmetric spacefiller with  flipper stretchers in place of the normally period  2 stretchers.  The pattern on the interior of this  spacefiller is forced by the stabilization requirements.  This spacefiller also exists in a vertically reflected  symmetric form that also has 187 points.<P>
<A HREF="pic3.html"><IMG SRC="pic3.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>

  A ~194 point spacefiller with all flipper  stretchers.  A couple of the escort spaceships  have been exploded to get some additional  point reduction :-)<P>
