<TITLE>Totally aperiodic patterns</TITLE>

Anyway, I boasted ... that now, someone can probably find a
finite configuration which grows so that every cell in the
universe is eventually aperiodic.

I see waves of gliders going back and forth across a widening river,
while four engines busily lengthen the banks and launch new gliders.
Synchronization might be tricky.

Right you are.  This thing could have been built in the late 70s:

Might be interesting to prove it works.  Also, it might work
with a p40 rake instead of p60.  And it might "leak".  But maybe
not fatally.  And thus be harder to prove.

Hashlife will take this thing about 500000 steps, but eventually
thrashes due to the logarithmic NWward creep creating new macrocells.
Greenwald's program should be able to run the sucker astronomically
far.

Here is an almost threefold smaller total aperiodic, based on DBuck's
amazing (non-Schick) p12 glider puffer:
