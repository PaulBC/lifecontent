4-barrelled p144 gun
This is a p144 gun based on an unnamed p72 oscillator found by
Bob Wainwright.  Two copies of the p72 together with a blocker and
2 eaters can duplicate a glider.  One output glider emerges in the
same direction as the original; the other is turned 90 degrees.
By putting together 4 such reflectors, a 4-barrelled gun  can be
built with period 144+72N for any N>=0.
This was built by David Buckingham some time before 11/21/91.
