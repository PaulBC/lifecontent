Shown above
is the <A HREF="stretch.html">wick stretcher</A>.
If you see just a heading, then your browser probably
doesn't support Java.
Other Life patterns can be found in
the <A HREF="contents.html">illustrated catalog</A>. 
The <A HREF="LifeApp.java">Java source code</A> is available,
and the <A HREF="#algorithm">algorithm</A> is described below.
<H2>Usage Notes</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
The above display is merely
a window on a Life pattern that might be much larger.
Scroll by clicking near the boundaries.
<LI>
The <STRONG>Recenter</STRONG> button translates the pattern so that
at least one live cell is in the window.  Use it
to find patterns that have moved off-screen.
<LI>
The <STRONG>"<"</STRONG> and <STRONG>">"</STRONG> buttons control
the magnification.
</UL>
<H2>Performance</H2>
The maximum update speed is set at 
20 generations per second.  The actual speed
will be slower for extremely large patterns (of which
there are many in the archive).  
This animator is only provided for convenience in viewing the
archive through the web.
Several simulators available through
the 
<A HREF="../lifepage.html">main Life page</A>
are orders of magnitude faster,
and are much better suited to viewing large patterns.
<P>
Patterns are downloaded as gif-encoded images.   The patterns
were originally converted to gif files
for display in the illustrated catalog.  This turned out
to be a very concise representation,
so downloading is not a bottleneck even for the patterns that look really big.
Once you see the gif, you have the pattern.
The Java API provides methods for
downloading images and extracting pixels,
and this novel application may be of interest to those
looking for an example of the PixelGrabber class.
<A NAME="algorithm"><H2>Life Algorithm</H2></A>
There are faster ways to do Life generation, but the approach
I used is fairly simple and sufficient for present needs.  
For a more sophisticated Life implementation,
see <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/life/">Alan
Hensel's web page</A>.
My two main criteria were to
impose no arbitrary limits on universe size, and to exploit
pattern sparsity.  Coding simplicity was also a big plus, since
I wanted to get this applet up and running <EM>correctly</EM> as soon as 
possible.

The primary data structure is a list of live cell coordinates in row-major
order.  That is, cells are ordered top to bottom, and then left to right
for cells on the same row.  A cell is stored as an int, with coordinates
packed into bit fields.  The sign bit is unused.  Bits 18-30 store the y
coordinate, bits 5-17 store the x coordinate, and bits 0-4 are reserved
for accumulating neighborhood information.
Note that sorting these int values in increasing order is equivalent to
sorting the cells in
row major order.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The astute reader may object that the universe
size is arbitrarily limited to 8192x8192.
That's true, but this is big enough for all the patterns in
the archive.  More importantly, the size is tied to
number representation rather than array allocation, so we could
make the universe big enough to satisfy just about anyone if we moved up to 64 bit words.

<P>
Now, given this representation, it is easy, for example, to compute the 
set of all neighbors to the east of live cells just by adding a displacement.
This operation also preserves row major order.  A list of cells and their
neighbors can also be merged while preserving row major order in the
same manner that sorted lists are merged for merge sort.  The only
difference is that if
cells have identical coordinates, we combine them by adding the contents of bits 0-4.
The method for this can be found in LifeGenerate.combineLists().
If we initialize the 0-4 bit field of each live cell to 2, then after a sequence of 
such merges, we obtain twice the total count of
cells in every non-empty 3x3 box in the Life universe.
<P>
Finally, we subtract 1 from the count obtained for each 
box centered at a live
cell.  It is easy to see that now the neighborhood list  
contains enough information to compute the next generation.
Bit 0 encodes whether the cell is live or dead, while bits 1-4
contain the number of neighbors.
A final pass using a lookup table computes the
next generation, discarding dead cells, while initializing
live cells for the next generation.
