Pseudorandom LWSS generator with p46 logic
A lightweight spaceship stream is emitted representing a
pseudorandom binary sequence satisfying the recursion
a[n] = a[n-1] XOR a[n-19].  (By spreading out the pattern,
the 19 can be changed.)  The sequence has period 413385,
so the gun has period 46*413385 = 19015710.
