t log(t) via stifled breeder
Population in generation t is asymptotic to  t log(t) / (6 log(3)).
A modified exponential aperiodic pattern emits a LWSS in gen
20*3^n + 32  (n >= 1).  Meanwhile, a breeder produces a line of
"stifled" guns, with eaters suppressing their outputs.  Each LWSS
destifles one gun.  So in gen t there are about  log(t)/log(3)
active guns, which have emitted about  t log(t)/(30 log(3))  gliders.
