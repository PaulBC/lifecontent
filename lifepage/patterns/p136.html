12-barrelled p136 glider gun
A 12-barrelled, period 136 glider gun, using 29 B-heptominoes moving
around a p3944 track consisting of 16 of David Buckingham's 64 gen
turns and 40 of his 73 gen turns.  This is the smallest possible
period that can be obtained using Buckingham's turns.  Any larger
multiple of 8 can also be obtained as a gun period.
