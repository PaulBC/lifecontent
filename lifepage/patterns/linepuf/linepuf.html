<H1>A History of Line Puffers</H1>

Back in 1993 and '94, Hartmut Holzwart was busy tweaking his search program
and generating large quantities of c/2 spaceships. He sent one of his
ordinary batches on March 11, 1994, and I was playing with it a few days
later. As a primitive means of destroying the end of spaceships to find
independent components, I put something near the tail end of one of the
spaceships. To my amazement, however, only a small 3-cell piece (which I
would later rediscover as a "puff suppressor") came off, and the rest of
it started to puff!

I had stumbled on a puffer. After a little bit of research, I realized that
this might be unusual, so on March 30, I reported it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I haven't seen it 
mentioned here, but one of Hartmut's more recent c/2 p2
spaceships makes a versatile puffer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When I said "versatile", I simply meant that I could add middleweight
spaceships to modify the puffs. I had no idea that I had just stumbled on
the first line puffer, and just how extensible and chaotic it could be.
<P>
The width of this first line puffer was 7. On April 6, David Bell reported
a similar puffer of width 5, which is so small that it just puffs a line
of blinkers. On the same day, Hartmut Holzwart wrote, "How the engine works
is easy to see" (in hindsight, he was right, but I had missed it), and he
proceeded to post several puffers with larger engines. That was the point
at which we realized that we were onto something: if these small widths
made great puffers, imagine what kind of chaos you could get from a width
of 100 or more. You wouldn't need to build random chaos generators into
Life programs anymore; Life would have a random chaos generator as a pattern.
<P>
That's when I began to play with David Bell's search program, and combine
the results with some of Hartmut's other p2 results in order to try to
construct a fully extensible version. On April 7, I posted the first
line puffer with fully extensible width by multiples of 12. For the
engineering side of things, all that was left was to optimize the size
of the supporting spaceships, and find ways to generate any width.
<P>
The results were inspiring. Bill Gosper wrote:

This line puffer is a fantastic, endless mural. When the technology is
cheap enough, it would make a great museum hallway, (wall or floor),
a few hundred cells high and a few thousand long, drifting back at about
walking speed.

There didn't seem to be much more to say about line puffers, until Tim Coe
came along.
<P>
On Oct 9, 1995, after running line puffers for long periods of time in a
Life program specially designed to measure the period of these objects,
Tim Coe announced that some of his puffers eventually blew up, and in fact,
line puffers are generally unstable with a half-life somewhere around 100
million generations. Even if their instability didn't come as a surprise,
their extreme longevity did.
<P>
Here is his explanation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dominant operating mode of line puffers is period 4.  The
immediate exhaust alternates between a 2 X ~N block of on cells
followed two generations later by a 4 or 5 X ~N block of on cells.
Occasionally this phase reverses itself.  During the process of
reversal part of the line puffer is operating in one phase and
part of it is operating in the other phase.  In both of the failures
that I have currently observed the line puffer decay was associated
with the defect between the two phases propagating to the edge.  You
can see the phase reversal begin at roughly generation 2600 of the
pattern that I included....  One of the defects propagates
to the edge resulting in engine failure 800 generations later.`

Here is the line puffer that blew up (okay, so it's not quite the Hindenburg
or the Space Shuttle Challenger, but you can see the similarity):

<P>
Now, to surprise those who might arrogantly claim that it is not surprising
at all for the line puffer to be unstable, since it is such an object that
generates so much chaos, about six months later on May 3, 1996 Tim Coe
unveiled a solution which seems to completely fix the instability:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
About six months ago I reported that the line puffer was unstable. Off and
on I have tried to come up with a fix for the instability.... It turns out
that almost all of the bits and pieces of this new line puffer were
previously known. My search program just put them together in a new way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here is the new and improved puffer that Tim Coe submitted, which to the
best of our knowledge is probably completely stable and extensible:

<P>
Here is the same puffer width and tail end, with the most robust of the
previously known technology (this blows up pretty soon after liftoff):
<P>

<P>
And finally, here is what Tim Coe set out to accomplish in the first place:
tabulated results for the period of each puffer width up to 79. This clearly
shows the ease with which the line puffer is capable of generating
exponentially greater amounts of chaos, out of a simple linear extension of
its width:
