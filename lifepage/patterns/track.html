p155 oscillator via B track
20 B heptominoes travel around a track of length 3100 gens,
consisting of 20 64 gen turns and 28 65 gen turns.  The turns use
the p5 oscillators "toaster" and "middleweight volcano".  Four of
the toasters are 2-slicers rather than the usual 4-slicers, to
avoid destroying nearby eaters.  Any period of the form 150+5n
(n>=0) can be obtained by using these components.
