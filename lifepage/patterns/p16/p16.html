<H1>Tim Coe's p16 puffer engine</H1>
Patterns such as the 
<A HREF="../gun30.html">p30 glider gun</A> 
and the 
<A HREF="../puftrain.html">p20 puffer train</A>
are well
known to anyone who has looked at the numerous published
references to Conway's Game of Life.  It is less widely recognized that
there is almost certainly a great wealth of
guns, puffers, and other interesting patterns
that have yet to be discovered.  A combination of 
computerized search, experience, and ingenuity has led to the
discovery of many such patterns over the years.
<P>
One very recent example is the p16 puffer engine found
by Tim Coe.  The following mail digest contains a number of
new patterns not archived elsewhere.  These letters
illustrate the speed at which such a discovery can be 
applied to new designs, given the tools and
experience that have developed over the years.
Images appearing on this page are links to
patterns that can be downloaded and viewed using a Life simulator.

<P>
I was looking through the output of one of my flipper
searches and I saw a ship that looked liked it might
be robust with respect to some amputation.  I ended
up with the following period 16 c/2 puffer engine that
by itself leaves no exhaust.  It is quite robust to
perturbation and I have included some amusing puffers
that I have managed to construct.

<P>
The new engine seemed ideally suited to an automated collision enumeration
(being so small and clean).  The enumeration (interactions between engines
and spaceships) turned up a smaller block puffer:
<P>
<A HREF="pic5.html"><IMG SRC="pic5.gif"></A>
<P>

The enumeration also found a blinker puffer (I haven't checked if it's 
identical to the one mentioned by Tim Coe).  I don't trust my choice
of parameters, and I'm going to try another enumeration, but for now I
have 14 results total.  Many are "dirty" puffers.  Some are simply
perturbations of the spark that do not actually result in a puffer.   
I put all the results together into the following pattern.  They don't
destroy each other but they do interact, so it will be necessary to
cut and paste to examine each other separately:
<P>
<A HREF="rle1.html"><IMG SRC="rle1.gif"></A>
<P>

I noticed that two of the interactions with an MWSS result in identical
exhaust.  However, the placements themselves are slightly different.  I
haven't done any "human" filtering of this file.  It's just the raw
results.
<P>
Another promising idea may be to react mirror images of the new
engine against each other.

Here are two more clean puffers based on the new engine. These were  
found by enumerating reactions of spaceships and dirty puffers composed 
of the engine and another spaceship.  I viewed all non-self-destructive
combinations in Xlife, and picked these out by eye.

<P>
I went over all the different puffers that came up in the enumeration
and selected those that seemed well-behaved.  Besides p16 puffers, there
are p32 puffers for blocks and tubs, and a p48 blinker puffer.
Here's the full set:
<P>
<A HREF="rle2.html"><IMG SRC="rle2.gif"></A>

Besides puffers, there were lots of spaceships.  Two had what seemed to
be interesting sparks.  The spark on this one is really big and chaotic:

Two of the dirty puffers I got with my original enumeration produced forward
gliders with period 32.  I tried adding another spaceship and managed to
stabilize the exhaust down to a block, but not eliminate it entirely.
Finally, I added another HWSS to get rid of the block, though I was
originally hoping I wouldn't have to.  Anyway, here is the resulting
p32 forward rake:

Neato!  The only improvement I see is that the trailing HWSS
could just as well be a MWSS and still delete the blocks cleanly.

I have recently downloaded the entire Life archives, and am working my way
through 4 years of back mail, fleshing out my collections of oscillators,
sparkers, eaters, etc.  When done, I intend to post them, including any
other stuff I have kicking around which has never been sent to the list.
<P>

To Dave Buckingham:
P256gun is extremely elegant (and not obvious;  even after seeing the original,
I spent two days trying to re-construct part of it from memory, and was not
able to stumble across the correct placement of even one of the blocks!)
<P>

To Tim Coe:  Congratulations on the new spaceship!
This is so simple (and the large part is similar to other
almost-spaceships which so often arise naturally), that it is amazing
that nobody found this one before.
<P>
Some minor additions to the new P16 spaceship:
<P>

A simple 2-part glider synthesis (eventually needing 9 gliders):
<P>
<A HREF="pic13.html"><IMG SRC="pic13.gif"></A>
<P>

This requires four gliders from the right side, making it suitable
for construction by puffers.  If the MWSS is made first and the
LWSS is inserted instead, it requires one glider from each direction,
making it more suitable for gun-based construction.
<P>

The spaceship can be widened by one (although I can't think of
how this would be useful, since it doesn't provide any extra
sparks, and is more difficult to construct and get close to
with catalyzing spaceships):
<P>
<A HREF="pic14.html"><IMG SRC="pic14.gif"></A>
<P>


The spaceship can be used as an improved HWSS for sparking other
puffers, since it has a P4 side-spark, but only a P16 tail-spark,
making it much less intrusive.
<P>
This simple blinker puffer works catalyzed by the P16 (and works in
3 out of the 4 possible phases), but eats a HWSS employed for the
same purpose.  There are probably lots of other almost-ran puffers
which have been overlooked because they attack an HWSS, but could
work successfully with the P16.
<P>
<A HREF="pic15.html"><IMG SRC="pic15.gif"></A>

Here are some more P32 mechanisms.  The first is a clean
P32 spaceship with a plume over 100 pixels long:

  A period 32 LWSS backrake.  The P32 forward  glider rake prevents period multiplying exhaust  reactions.  The P32 sparker's purpose is to  get rid of a pesky beehive that I could not  eradicate with spaceships.<P>

  This is the period 4 flipper ship that I  cut up to create the P16 puffer engine.  This illustrates how two engines can share  a stabilizing spaceship and be either 60  or 180 degrees out of phase.<P>

The new p16 engine is real nice!  I have impacted gliders into it in various
ways to see what results.  Many different objects can be formed without
destroying the engine, including one of the rare still-lifes.
<P>
This is the most important result.  The following shows a forwards glider
being converted into a LWSS which travels upwards:
<P>
<A HREF="pic20.html"><IMG SRC="pic20.gif"></A>
<P>


The reaction just barely fails to be repeatable every 16 generations, sigh.
But it easily runs every 32 generations.
<P>
Here is a sideways LWSS rake based on this and the recent p32 forwards rake:
<P>
<A HREF="rle5.html"><IMG SRC="rle5.gif"></A>
<P>


If a smaller forwards rake can be found, then this LWSS puffer can be
correspondingly improved.
<P>
Finally, here are some glider turning reactions that I found.
In these three, forwards gliders are reflected back the way they came.
The outgoing phase differs for each of these reactions.
<P>
<A HREF="rle6.html"><IMG SRC="rle6.gif"></A>
<P>


Here is a glider turning reaction which turns a backwards traveling
glider 90 degrees still moving to the back.  The rear spaceship is just
there to delete a loaf.
<P>
<A HREF="rle7.html"><IMG SRC="rle7.gif"></A>
<P>


It is a shame that no trivial backwards to forwards glider turning reaction
exists with this engine.  But that can be done using a few standard spaceships
anyway...

Here are more results concerning the new puffer engine...
<P>
Here is a relatively small p16 forwards glider rake.  This is easily
built from the previous backwards p16 rake and a glider turning reaction:
<P>
<A HREF="rle8.html"><IMG SRC="rle8.gif"></A>
<P>


Here are two reactions in which a LWSS is turned into a glider by the new
p16 engine.  One of these creates a forwards glider and the other one creates
a backwards glider.  (These might be useful because of my previously shown
glider to LWSS reaction.)
<P>
<A HREF="rle9.html"><IMG SRC="rle9.gif"></A>
<P>


Here is a reaction in which the new p32 big spark turns a block into
a glider:
<P>
<A HREF="rle10.html"><IMG SRC="rle10.gif"></A>
<P>


Finally here is a reaction in which the p32 big spark engine turns a block
into a glider and another block in the same column as the original one:
<P>
<A HREF="rle11.html"><IMG SRC="rle11.gif"></A>
<P>


By using two copies of this reaction in succession, and adding an extra
spaceship to delete the extra glider, you can create a "readout" device,
where a row of blocks can be non-destructively scanned into corresponding
glider outputs.  The blocks can be placed every 16 cells along the row.
The following shows the block pattern 1101 being read out:
<P>
<A HREF="rle12.html"><IMG SRC="rle12.gif"></A>
<P>


This is pretty complicated for what it does, but was interesting to find!
Does anyone know of a simpler readout device which can non-destructively
turn a row of objects into gliders?

Here is a backwards p32 rake made from the new p16 engine:
<P>
<A HREF="rle13.html"><IMG SRC="rle13.gif"></A>

If the rear beehive is deleted, then a different backwards glider is
produced from the other side of the puffer, as in the following rake:
<P>
<A HREF="rle14.html"><IMG SRC="rle14.gif"></A>
<P>


Deleting the behive on demand with forwards gliders also works,
switching the output gliders from one side of the rake to the other:
<P>
<A HREF="rle15.html"><IMG SRC="rle15.gif"></A>
