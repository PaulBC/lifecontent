<P>

I occasionally run searches that provide
more feedback than my c/5 search.  Here
are couple of diagonal c/4 ships that
have rather large sparks.  I am sending
them out as they emerged from my search
program.  All this means is that the
glider accompanying the first ship is
actually superfluous.  (I did add the
leading space by hand though).

The first of Coe's sparkers readily yields a new boat/tub extender:

After sending out those sparkers yesterday it occurred to me
that were good for nothing (except of course Noam's boat
stretcher) without something colliding with the sparks.
<P>
I had built a few ship rakes back when period 16 puffer
activity was running fast and furious, so I started firing
them at the diagonal sparkers.  The included pattern summarizes
the most interesting collisions I came across.  I just wrote
an coordinate to rle converter.  I do not have any thing that
reads rle directly, but a conversion back to coordinates revealed
no differences.  Please tell if there is anything wrong in my
rle representation.
<P>
It has been alluded to in a couple of places that the c/5 ship
I found would most appropriately be called a snail.  I also think
that the smaller diagonal sparker looks like a swan.
<P>
Have a happy day,
