<TITLE>Extensible delay-line memory</TITLE>
<H1>My improved delay line</H1>
Several years ago, I posted some articles on the 
construction of a delay line memory that can be used as
the infinite store of a universal computer embedded in Life.
I have since improved the design significantly,  
making it both smaller and simpler.  This construction
is not really a new result, as I completed it in 1994,
but it has not been presented elsewhere, and might be
of interest to those curious about Life universality.
<P>
The first universality proof, presented
in <EM>Winning Ways</EM>
(see Alan Hensel's
<A HREF="../../lifebiblio.html">bibliography</A>),
was based on the construction of a counter memory.
A counter memory stores an integer that can be incremented, decremented, and
tested for equality to zero.  In the Life
implementation, the counter value is stored
as the position of a block, and can (in principle) be incremented
and decremented using a
<A HREF="../pusher.html">block pusher</A>
and a
<A HREF="../puller.html">block puller,</A>
respectively.
There is probably no way to fit these two patterns together to build
a counter memory, but Dean Hickerson constructed a functioning
<A HREF="../sbm/sbm.html">sliding block memory</A> using a different design.
<P>
A counter stores an integer of unbounded size and can thus
encode arbitrarily many bits.  These can be extracted using
some clever techniques involving several counters at once
(hint: think of how to divide an integer by two and get
the remainder just by incrementing and decrementing counters).
However, using counters to simulate tape on a Turing machine
introduces an exponential slowdown.
A delay-line memory, by contrast, can
simulate a Turing tape with only polynomial slowdown,
making it more practical (if the word has any meaning at all
in this context).  
Interestingly, one of the first computers built in <EM>real</EM> life,
the <A HREF="http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/time/msb-chronology-of-dcm.html#edsac">EDSAC</A>,
used a delay-line memory, consisting of a tank of mercury through
which ultrasonic pulses were recirculated.
<P>
In Life, a delay line stores a sequence of bits
by endlessly recirculating a stream of gliders or spaceships.
Many finite delay-line constructions
have been designed, such as a
<A HREF="../randgun.html">pseudorandom glider gun</A>
that generates a very complicated-looking sequence of gliders
by XORing contents of the delay line and recirculating them.
The pattern described here is more powerful, because it allows
the delay line to be lengthened by the
finite control.  This makes it possible to increase the
size of storage as needed.  
<H1>The construction</H1>
We can construct 
one kind of delay-line memory using two MWSS (medium-weight spaceship) 
streams, one traveling right, and the other traveling left.
We position them so that they normally pass harmlessly, but will react
in the presence of an eater.  
<P>
Specifically,
they pass in <A HREF="pass.html"><IMG SRC="pass.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A>
but react in
<A HREF="collide.html"><IMG SRC="collide.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A>
.
<P>
In the second case, the two spaceships mutually annihilate,
leaving the eater intact.  (They
also produce a northeast glider, which is incidental, but potentially
useful in a construction.)  If the rightward spaceship were not
there, however, then the leftward spaceship would continue through.
We assume there is always a leftward spaceship, so the result is to
reflect the rightward stream to the left, but with inverted logic.
For example, the following reflects and inverts a stream 
in which the third out of four spaceships is missing:
<P>
<A HREF="inv1101.html"><IMG SRC="inv1101.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A>
<P>
To construct a recirculating loop in this way,
we place an eater at the right end of the loop, and another at the
left end so that the reaction is rotated 180 degrees and reflects
the leftward stream to the right. This also inverts the
logic a second time, restoring the stream to positive logic.  
The result is that between the two 
eaters, bits are recirculated, provided that synchronized MWSS streams enter 
at the left and right ends.  The number of bits in the loop is controlled
by the distance between the two eaters.  At any instant, about
half the bits are stored in the rightward stream in positive logic,
while the other half are stored in the leftward stream in negative logic.
<P>
So far, this works for an arbitrarily large finite loop between
two synchronized MWSS guns.  To make it
extensible, we use not just one right-end eater, but a whole series of them,
which can be laid out by a puffer,
and we use an 
<A HREF="../mwssrak2.html">MWSS backrake</A> as the source 
of the leftward stream.
Then, it turns out to be possible to extend
the loop by annihilating the leftmost right-end eater.
<P>
In the current design,
the rightward spaceship stream is produced by a p120 gun.  The leftward
spaceship stream is produced by a p60 c/2 rightward puffer.  Note
that the stream 
itself is p120 because it is generated by a moving source (analogous to
the doppler effect).  That gives us the synchronized spaceship streams
we need.  
Schematically, we have something like:
<PRE>
                         el
                           l1   l2   l3   l4   l5   l6  ssp                 
   ssg   r4   r3   r2   r1
                             er1  er2  er3  er4  er5  er6  ep 
<P>

ssg  = gun producing rightward spaceships
ssp  = puffer producing leftward spaceships
ep   = puffer producing right eaters
el   = left eater
li   = one of the leftward spaceships
ri   = one of the rightward spaceships
eri  = one of the right eaters
</PRE>
So, you can see how a rightward spaceship produced by another gun could be
used to lengthen the loop by destroying a right eater.  
Note that the puffer is producing eaters
faster than any computation device could possibly fill up the
loop with bits, so the memory is in effect unbounded.
<P>
One can read the loop using the glider stream output by the
left eater when an annihilation occurs 
Incidentally, there are other ways to detect
a MWSS without destroying it, since it produces a spark.
<P>
To write to the loop, one can use the fact that logic is positive in
the rightward part of the loop and negative in the leftward part.
A bit can be set to 0 by annihilating a spaceship in the
rightward stream, or to 1 by annihilating a spaceship in the leftward
stream.
<P>
To simulate a Turing machine using a delay line, one must let the
loop recirculate to simulate a backward move.  This is slow, but only
a polynomial slowdown.
A complete delay line is shown below.
One could build a universal computer from it by adding a finite
control to read and modify the contents.
<P>
<A HREF="delay.html"><IMG SRC="delay.gif"></A>
<P>
In the above
pattern, there is a gun set up to produce loop-lengthening spaceships,
but it is normally suppressed by a glider stream.
One incoming glider is included to suppress the suppressing stream, thus
releasing a spaceship to lengthen the loop.  Initial bit contents of
the loop are 01, based on a positive logic rightward stream.  When the
loop is lengthened, the new contents become 011 (a 1 is always what's
inserted).
<P>
The output glider stream can be interpreted as as 010101011011011011...
That is, the loop is lengthened after three full cycles.
<P>
If you download the pattern to play with 
interactively, you can try extending the
loop by removing spaceship-suppressing gliders, or
modifying the contents of the stream by removing spaceships between
the left and right eaters of the loop.  However, removing spaceships
outside these bounds may cause unexpected results.
