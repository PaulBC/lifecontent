In the above pattern, there is a gun set up 
to produce loop-lengthening spaceships, but it is
normally suppressed by a glider stream. 
One incoming glider is included to suppress the
suppressing stream, thus 
releasing a spaceship to lengthen the loop. Initial bit contents of the loop
are 01, based on a positive logic rightward stream. 
When the loop is lengthened, the new contents
become 011 (a 1 is always what's inserted). 
<P>
The output glider stream can be interpreted as as 010101011011011011... 
That is, the loop is
lengthened after three full cycles.
