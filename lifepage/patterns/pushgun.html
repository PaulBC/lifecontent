Sqrtgun 10.1
Population in generation t is asymptotic to  sqrt(5t/8).
A 3 glider salvo pushes a block 10 units southeast and sends back
2 gliders, which cause another salvo to be fired and a glider to
be sent southwest.  The round trip time, and hence the gap between
southwestward gliders, increases by an average of 80 generations each
time.  More specifically, let  a[0]=a[2]=199  and  a[1]=-1.  Then, for
n>=0, a glider is sent southwest (by reflection from a buckaroo) in
generation  40 n^2 + 1120 n + a[n mod 3]  (at which time the population
is  5n + 1115)  and escapes about 270 generations later.
