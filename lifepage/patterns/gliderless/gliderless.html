<H1>Gliderless spaceship guns</H1>
It's been known for a long time that certain collisions of
gliders result in larger spaceships (see for example
<A HREF="../makefish.html">makefish.lif</A>).
This has led to the design of many spaceship "factories" (or
equivalently guns) in which the output of glider guns is
combined, sometimes with sparks from other oscillators as well,
to produce a stream of spaceships.  An example is
the compact light-weight spaceship gun 
<A HREF="../lwssgun.html">lwssgun.lif</A>.
Recently, a number of elegant new
spaceship guns have been found
(mostly by Dieter Leithner) 
that do not require any glider collisions at all.

<EM>Subject: Period 46 Spaceship Factories</EM><BR>
<P>
All three varieties of p46 spaceship factories can easily by constructed by
using three p46 glider guns and one of the three-glider reactions (compiled
in my posting on p30 spaceship factories) which synthesize a simple
spaceship (LWSS, MWSS, HWSS). However, for period 46 other
spaceship-producing reactions exist which use fewer than three glider
streams and therefore lead to smaller factories.
<P>

Minimum-Area Lightweight Spaceship Factory of Period 46
<P>
Here, a particularly beautiful reaction where a single glider strikes the
long spark of a p46 shuttle and transforms it(self) into a LWSS is truly
"striking". Over time, many life enthusiasts must have discovered the
reaction independently, because it is so simple. The unexpected finding of
this amazing reaction probably was an exciting thrill for all its
discoverers. Who first found this jewel? And when?
<P>
I believe, the following LWSS factory (constructed 31 Oct 1993) to be of
minimum size. It too was probably constructed independently more than once.
Is an even smaller p46 LWSS factory known?
<P>
<A HREF="pic1.html"><IMG SRC="pic1.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>


Minimum-Area Middleweight Spaceship Factory of Period 46
<P>
There are p46 MWSS factories which are similar to the above LWSS factory in
that they use only a single p46 gun shooting at a spark produced by p46
shuttles. Surprisingly, the following MWSS factory which includes two guns
is smaller than all the one-gun factories I know. I constructed it 24 Apr
1996. Because of its extra gun, I don't believe that this p46 MWSS factory
really is the smallest possible. Is a smaller example known?
<P>
<A HREF="pic2.html"><IMG SRC="pic2.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>


Minimum-Area Heavyweight Spaceship Factory of Period 46
<P>
In June of 1992 I constructed my first p46 HWSS factory by using the three
glider to HWSS reaction shown in my posting on p30 spaceship factories.
Since then I found a number of other HWSS-producing reactions, some of
which allowed me to build consecutively smaller factories. My smallest p46
HWSS factory yet (constructed 2 May 1996) is shown below. It involves a
similar reaction to the one used in the minimum-area p30 HWSS factory: Two
pi heptominos react with a special "spark" (actually it is not a spark
because without the two pi's it would not vanish) to form the HWSS. Two
details of the construction reduce the area of the factory:
<P>
- Each pi is made only by a single glider from the spark of a p46 shuttle.
- A compact version of the p46 gun, which fits into a 32 x 32 square,  is
  used. (I found that gun on 28 Apr 1996).
<P>
Possibly, this small HWSS factory could be made even smaller, if the pi
heptominos could be manufactured without gliders. I searched for and found
several examples where two or three p46 shuttles synthesize a pi. However,
none is suited for use in the HWSS factory because in all cases, at least
one of the shuttles which manufacture the pi's interferes with one of the
shuttles making the "spark". Can someone manufacture suitably located pi's
using p46 shuttles?
<P>
<A HREF="pic3.html"><IMG SRC="pic3.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>


Glider-less Lightweight Spaceship Factory of Period 46
<P>
The following p46 LWSS factory is larger in size than the one shown at the
top of this e-mail. However, it is special in the sense, that it is a
"direct" spaceship factory, i.e. one without gliders. Since about two years
I was searching for such "glider-less" spaceship factories until on 19 Apr
1996 I finally found the one shown here. It is composed of two p46
factories, where one factory periodically produces an r pentomino while the
other manufactures a traffic light precursor. The two newly manufactured
items immediately react to form a LWSS which flies away in time to clear
the site for the next production cycle.

Are other glider-less spaceship factories known?

Here is a simpler and smaller gliderless period 46 LWSS gun than the one
previously shown by Dieter Leithner:
<P>
<A HREF="rle1.html"><IMG SRC="rle1.gif"></A>
<P>


Like Dieter's original gliderless LWSS gun, this uses an interaction
between an evolving R-pentomino and a traffic lights to produce the LWSS.
The R-pentomino reaction is the same.  But the traffic lights reaction
is one I found which produces both a traffic lights and a glider.
The glider would destroy the emerging LWSS and so must be removed, but
there is not very much room available.  Fortunately, a pair of blocks
is able to do the job as shown here.
<P>
The double block reaction is also used elsewhere in the construction to
shrink the total area of the gun.  Perhaps this same reaction could be
used in some of Dieter's other minimal area guns to shrink their area too.
<P>
I don't think that the double block reaction is new.  I vaguely remember
that someone mentioned a long while ago about shortening the p46 shuttle.
Will the original discoverer of this reaction please stand up?

<EM>Subject: Happy Birthday David Buckingham!</EM><BR>
<P>
Late last year I constructed a new gun. As far as I know, it is the first
glider-less HWSS gun and contains the first direct (i.e. glider-less)
Herschel factory.
<P>
When I started to write a note on that gun to the Life list, I realized
that all major parts used in the construction were found by David
Buckingham. No surprise here: without Buckingham's countless findings, this
construction, as well as many others, would not have come into being. Even
the idea to search for Herschel factories probably would not have occurred
to me if I had not seen Buckingham's B-heptomino stages in Oct 1996. So it
seemed appropriate to postpone this note for a little while and send it on
a special occasion: Buckingham's birthday. Which is today.
<P>
Happy birthday David Buckingham! And thanks for the inspiration in the form
of the many many Life goodies you gave to all of us.
<P>
<STRONG>Glider-less p176 HWSS gun, a birthday present for David Buckingham
</STRONG>
<BR>
  The gun uses two copies of a glider-less Herschel factory each of
  which consists of two modified copies of Buckingham's p44 oscilla-
  tor (1992). Every 176 generations the colliding exhausts from two
  p44 engines create a B-heptomino which is quickly guided out of the
  Herschel factory's interior by Buckingham's elegant B-heptomino to
  Herschel conduit, a block and a snake. Two Herschels then react to
  produce two pi-heptominos, each of which is transformed into a HWSS
  assisted by a galaxy and a boat, a beautiful device, found in its
  original form (with a figure 8) by David Buckingham (before 1990).

<EM>Subject: Herschel to pi conduit</EM><BR>
<P>
Here's something I've wanted for a while.  A faulty version came up in a
search, but I realize I could use the part from Buckingham's 112-step turn that
eats an unwanted b-heptomino.  The only other part needed is a block, which
replaces two eaters in the 112-step turn.
<P>
<A HREF="pic5.html"><IMG SRC="pic5.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>


The pi appears after 95 steps pointing down, and far enough below the lowest
eater to make into an HWSS in either direction.  Two gliders are also
produced. 
<P>
Now, using Dieter's gliderless period-176 Herschel factory, we get a
smaller HWSS-gun than the one he posted for Buckingham's birthday (but it 
produces some gliders as a side effect; does it still count as "gliderless"?).  
One glider has to be eaten to avoid a self-collision with the Herschel
factory, and the other is coincidentally eliminated by the back spark
of one of the HWSS emulators:

Here are some more gliderless spaceship guns, including guns for 
all three spaceship sizes (LWSS, MWSS, HWSS), three different engines 
(Dave Buckingham's p44, Bill Gosper's p46 and Noam Elkies' p50) and 
six periods ranging from 44 to 184.
<P>
Two days ago I tried to get an edge spark from the p44 oscillator by 
placing additional eaters after the unusual eater reaction used in 
Paul's p44 glider gun. I was not at all prepared for what happened 
when in one of the attempts the would-be spark suddenly flew away:

<P>

An amazing reaction! The whole MWSS gun is very similar to Paul's 
glider gun. Only a standard eater is replaced by an eater2 and moved 
to a different location. (Paul, why was it not discovered by your 
automated search which found your p44 glider gun?) As far as I know, 
this p44 MWSS gun is also the smallest MWSS gun of any period, 
including MWSS guns which use gliders.
<P>
For a long time I considered the following incomplete pattern to be my best
chance to construct a gliderless spaceship gun. In 1995, when I found that

bits (indicated above by 1, 2, 13, 24, 136 and 245), the completion of the

But such is Life: I did not search for
the p44 MWSS gun and stumbled over it. On the other hand I had to search a
long time to find a suitable p46 sparker to complete the supposedly easy
p46 LWSS gun. The new p46 gun is larger than David Bell's minimum area
specimen (see David's posting of 14 Oct 1996) and also larger than my first
gliderless LWSS gun (see my posting of 6 Aug 1996). Maybe, someone knows a
smaller p46 sparker.

It is well known that certain periods of LWSS guns can be doubled and
quadrupled in a simple way by filtering the LWSS stream with emulators and
blockers. The following p92 LWSS gun and the p184 LWSS gun shown later
illustrate that technique:
