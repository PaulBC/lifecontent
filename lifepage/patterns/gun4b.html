4-barrelled p500 glider gun
A 4-barrelled, period 500 glider gun, based on a reaction in which
2 gliders become 3.  The 2 gliders hit a block, forming an
R-pentomino which, catalyzed by a snake, 2 blocks, a ship, and an
eater, re-forms the block and produces 3 gliders.  The gun contains
4 copies of this reaction; 4 of the 12 output gliders escape, the
other 8 are reflected from centinals (a p100 oscillator found by
Bill Gosper) to cause the reactions to repeat.
Built by David Buckingham about 11/17/92
