<TITLE>Buckingham on B-heptomino/Herschel oscillators</TITLE>
<H1>My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</H1>
<CITE>by Dave Buckingham (12-Oct-96)</CITE>
<P>
I first saw the versitility of the B-heptomino when I discovered the
curious period 54 twin bees oscillator back in 1973,  by putting eaters
around a twin bees oscillator and moving them back.  If the
eaters are moved one space in, no oscillator; one more and a twin bees.
Curious object indeed.
<P>
At almost the same time in 1973, Mark Niemiec was investigating appearance of
known common forms (B, R, Lom, Pi, etc) within the histories of these same
objects.  He showed me a listing of the most promising observation: a
B-heptomino run to 70 generations (quite a feat in those days!), where he
had highlighted the evolution of a new B-heptomino at generation 64,
turned 90 degrees.  And since the B-heptomino releases a natural glider
in generation 41, period 64, 128, and 256 guns appeared to be an absolute
certainty as soon as someone tamed the pesky debris behind this new B!
But most work in those days was done manually (gasp!) and this was not a
manual job.  Besides, in hindsight, there are more pitfalls than we could
have imagined.
<P>
During this time, I had started a systematic construction of all terminal
objects less than 15 bits and was still investigating small oscillator
construction, so there was little time for other problems.  I had not yet
imagined the B-tracks that form the basis of later work, but thought that
objects could be sheparded through an possible assortment of transformations
(R->B, B->LOM, LOM->Pi, etc. returning eventually to the original object
and position).  Adding additional track pieces, like building a model
railway set, would produce different periods.  Although I casually collected
interesting transformations over the next 15 years, there were many more
projects to be pursued (Life and otherwise).  Besides, we (Mark Niemiec and
myself) hit university and had access to a mainframe (real computing power)
and could start doing REAL LIFE!
<P>
(Skipping ahead to 1987:)
<P>
Although I have been programming forever (or maybe it just seems that way),
I didn't get my own machine until 1987 and, of course, promptly wrote a life
programme and started to enter as much of the manual work gathered through
the years as I still had.  Additionally, I had started to work on new stuff
in earnest for the first time in years.
<P>
One of the first things I set about to create was a glider gun, since I had
not yet found one.  After some experimentation, I found a collision
of a honeyfarm predicessor and a glider, which in 105 generations produces the
honeyfarm predicessor, a glider, and a B-heptomino.  It appeared that a gun
should be simple to construct: just reflect the initial glider to move engine,
and get the glider the B-heptomino creates at generation 41.  The whole
construction would be P210 (a multiple of 30), and reflecting P30n
glider streams is easy.
<P>
(Reality strikes:)
<P>
The first glider produced from the honeyfarm collisions is in the wrong phase
and is released too close to the engine; we're doing well so far.  OK, so
we must get 2 gliders from the B, but how to do it?
<P>
(Leap of Faith:)
<P>
Even though the B-heptomino does produce 2 gliders with a small amount of
residual debris, it appeared that this history was too difficult to
modify successfully, and required more time than the mechanism could spare.
Consequently, I decided to place a block in the path of the B-heptomino
in the hopes that a modifiable object might be produced, from which could
be coaxed gliders and then either put the block back, or more likely,
allow the eatering or sparking of the debris to recreate it.
No more than a couple dozen sites yielded the necessary reaction, which I
think of as a catalyst; Gosper called it "the transparent debris effect."

<P>

This reaction generates some non-specific, but prolific, debris and the original
block, which can be sparked (and later, eatered) to cleanly generate 2 gliders
to produce an interesting, but unsatisfying, period 210 gun.

<P>

Additional work eventually yielded a way to turn this catalyzed debris into two
gliders without the need for the pentadecathlon.
<P>
In a phone conversion with Gosper at the time, I was informed that he considerd
period 210 as an unworthy gun period, since it wasa multiple of period 30
(to be fair though, he did recant this opionion when the gun was sent in
the mail).  OK, return to the original concept of racing B-heptominos in
fixed tracks.
<P>
(Slight Hyperlink aside:)
<P>
Bob Wainwright's cute period 72 R-pentomino shuttle arrived by Snail Mail
courtesy of Hickerson in July 1990.  So, I checked out the glider collisions
into its debris.  One of these yields a B-heptomino, and even removes the
nusance block.  Combining this result with the transparent-debris reaction
yields an interesting set of gun periods (P144+72n), which someone called
"Gunstars."

Given the Gunstar results, it seemed reasonable that the transparent
block reaction might yield other interesting results, but other than
several ways of transforming a B into 1->3 gliders, only one truely
interesting result allowed the building of a mod 8 based period 856 gun.

<P>
Most of the old notes regarding object transformations and other interesting
events have been long lost, or perhaps just misplaced, but that's academic;
I don't believe anything of any real value was recorded anyhow.  Resurrecting
Niemiec's old listing of the B-heptomino reproducing itself at generation 64,
I set about to create the period 64 gun to start.
<P>
I needed a spark source and since most of the neat spark toys that exist
now had yet to fall out the search programmes, only period 8 (and subperiods)
was practical (Figure-8, Kok's Galaxy, Emulators, Mold, Mazing).
<P>
With these tools, the new B-heptomino was quickly isolated, but the new (and
unanticipated challenge was to remove the block created by the B-heptomino at
generation 15.  Adding to this distress, the new B-heptomino makes such a
sharp turn that removal of debris block from the previous B-heptomino at
generation 57 becomes a problem.  Ok, the debris removal process would need
to remove the two blocks and the residual debris from the turn reaction.
<P>
After a few weeks work, the reaction is found, the P64 gun constructed and
lo and behold, the glider produced by each B at generation 41 smashes into
one of the Galaxys used.  Sheesh, I forgot that the glider passes back through
the mechanism!  No problem, we'll just find another way to turn a
B-heptomino and use these two in combination.  More work and the elegant
sparking of a B-heptomino to produce the P73 glide symmetry turn; debris
dies cleanly, while removing the generation 15 block, and the glider produced
by the B removes the block from the previous B.  This time we'll test a
quarter of the mechanism before building the whole thing.  Now the glider
just nicks the figure-8 for the P73 turn.  Even more work, a P64 turn
that removes the debris, both blocks, and the glider.  Build it, P584
Swiss Cross.  But wouldn't you know it, the thing is barren; the whole
exercise is moot!
<P>
(A few months pass:)
<P>
I've got the Swiss Cross and it is extensible, so how can I coax a glider
out of it?  Rubbing them together seems a futile exercise, and a few months
of examples seem to bear this out.  The P73 turn does expose some isolated
debris; perhaps it can be sparked.  Finally, effort is rewarded and thankfully
very little effort is required to produce the much anticipated glider using
Wainwright's P8 Blocker, while the function of the P73 turn is not impared.
<P>

<P>

B-heptominos could be lined up in the track and be compressed to
136 generations, so this configuration represented glider guns of
periods 136+8n!  For the next while, I busied myself assembling a set of
alternate B-heptomino stages (P65, etc) on a P8 base.  Then it was
mailed to the Life group.
<P>
A P6 variant of the B track (B-train?) proved relatively easy to construct,
but since there didn't (and still doesn't really) exist a P6 domino sparker,
this period was also sterile.  With the search work done to this point by
Hickerson, periods 3, 4, and 5 were also realizable, but since they would
also be sterile, there was no sense in persuing them.  I had constructed
a number of different period stages for the period 6 work, but none of
them solved the fertility problem.
<P>
(Problem Explanation:)
<P>
Each of the known mechanisms each suffered from the same problem; the new
B produced by each was either at the reaction site or slightly upwind from it.
Consequently, the glider produced by the receding B would be aimed at one
of the reaction sparkers or eaters.  Since the generation 15 block of the
B had to be removed by the debris cleanup, the new formed B could not likely
be too far from the debris it left.
<P>
(End of Problem Explanation:)
<P>
In late 1993, the solution suddenly became obvious (although not solved,
of course).  If the escaping B (responsible for the P73 turn) were removed
from the developing B, then perhaps the remaining R-pentomino could be
tamed producing a new B considerably downwind of the reaction site.  This
new B could release it's glider freely producing a glider gun.  The first
P6 implementation of this is shown below.
<P>

<P>
<A HREF="rle6.html"><IMG SRC="rle6.gif"></A>
<P>

Variations on this theme for P4 and P5 were fairly easily checked for
suitability, but the actual guns were not built until the summer of 1995.
Rich Schroeppel was attending a conference at the University of Waterloo,
and had arranged to come to visit.  The guns were hastily built along with
a barren P3-based construction (to demonstrate the feasability of such a
period) for his visit.
<P>
To this point P150+3n, P152+4n, P150+5n, P150+6n, and P136+8n were all now
constructable and produced gliders except for the P3 variants.
<P>
(Reality's Cutting Edge:)
<P>
Not a bad result to this point, but two issues surfaced at this point:
1) unless search programmes or other heuristics became significantly better
in the near future, larger sparker periods were unlikely, and 2) these new
periods do nothing to advance the production of oscillators of interesting
periods (prime!).
<P>
Attempts to produce period-independent track pieces (bounded only by still
lifes) had failed over the previous 23 years to yield much of anything
useful.  Suddenly (clouds open, sun shines, angels sing) a fluke placement
of a block (and subsequent stabilizing blocks), produces the period 64
B-heptomino turn dreamt of in 1973 (as classy and elegant as it was supposed
to be).  This was the first period independent B-heptomino turn and yielded the
P256 gun (as shown), but since the released gliders pass through the mechanism,
this is the only period glider gun possible (with a Figure 8, the gliders
can be removed, and 4 B's cycled, but defeats the purpose).  Ergo, still
no period 64 gun!

In a conversation with Niemiec at the time, I mentioned that I had three
long playing B-heptomino reactions, which could eventually (probably a
long eventually), be engineered to remove the oscillators they minimally
required.  They each run sufficiently long, that the choices for
stable intervention are quite high.  It was difficult to imagine that one
of these reactions would not someday fill the void.  (I had imagined that
a period-independent gun would probably be a minimum period 400->500
with these reactions.)

But before much time could be wasted on these options, fate smiled once
more.  Once again, I placed a block randomly near the transient B-heptomino
generated during the B history at generation 64.  This block turned the
B-heptomino into an R-pentomino, leaving the rest of the debris untouched.
<P>
(Technical Aside:)
<P>
In my experience, R-pentominos have had little use in the marketplace except
as transient objects on the way to producing B-heptominos.  Several methods
of taming the R-pentomino into a B (Herschel) with small transient using
stable objects have long been known.  A common example is that used in the
P500 gun sent to the life group.  I will discuss these methods later.
<P>
(End of Technical Aside:)
<P>
Without attempting any other solution, I placed a snake to reduce the
R-pentomino to B-heptomino and block.  When the dust settled, and astonished
disbelief faded, the block was in exactly the same position as it had started
and a clean B-heptomino (Herschel) had been translated forward in 39
generations.  Interestingly, the snake could not have been placed in the
original context!

With this new mechanism, there is no longer a necessity to do copious
debris cleanup, or to remove the transient B-heptomino block.  Modifying
a B-heptomino, in a period-independent way, to produce a new B-heptomino
instead of a Herschel finally reduces the task to something civilized.
The first new result was immediate.  The same B-heptomino phase used in
the P73 glide-symmetry turn could be modified to produce a P112 90-degree
turn (the R->Herschel conduit flips the B-heptomino).  Using the mechanism,
a small period period 112 emerges!

<P>

With the period 64 mechanism, larger guns can be built, but
the minimum compression is 153 generations.  (I use the term "compression" to
designate the spacing, in generations, between the B-heptominos, and "delay",
to specify the period between the B-heptomino beginning and end the stage.)
<P>
Without additional modification, any stage involving a B-heptomino that
evolves long enough to allow its first glider to escape cannot be compressed
to less than 69 generations.  If an eater is used to remove this glider,
the compression drops to 63, and if an eater2 is used, the compression
tops out at 61 generations.  This fact raises a very appealing point:
with one or more additional mechanisms, oscillators of periods 61+n could
be built!
<P>
To make a much too long story a little shorter, I poured back over the
terrain already harvested with sparkers and generated a total of 8 useful
B-heptomino stages, summarized below.

</PRE>
Curiously, the period 64, 77, 119, and 158 stages do not use the B-heptomino
conduit that initially seemed vital to period independence.  The period 77
and 119 mechanisms especially, work the way I had imaged most likely
20-odd years ago.  Some object interacts with a block to produce a
B-heptomino, and this new B-heptomino replaces that block with its own.

The period 77 stage can be sparked with a single-bit to produce a glider.
This is useful for the periods 61 through 69, where the natural B-heptomino
glider must be removed.  The debris from the stage can also be used to
reflect gliders, and in one case, photomultiply.  The sparking mechanism
is even more significant, since period 61 is still gliderless and only
the periods 77 and 112 can be compressed to this point.

(No More Allusions:)
<P>
The stages so far uncovered can be used to construct gliders of every
period >= 62, leaving only the period 61 oscillator gliderless, but at least
it does exist and is presented here with what I believe are the minimum
constructions of each of the guns of periods 62-69.  At period 69 and
above, the natural glider produced by the B-heptomino can safely escape
making most stages gliderific; the period 69 illustrates this phenomenon.
<P>
The period 68 is presented twice: the first using no oscillator, and the
second using a sparker to create a smaller configuration.
<P>
Since there have not yet been found any 90 degree glide-symmetry turns,
the period 61 oscillator illustrates how large "corals" can be built
using the translate and flip stages (i.e. period 77).

(In Conclusion:)
<P>
Were does this leave us?  Well nowhere really.  The universe is still
pretty much the same as it was yesterday, but...
<P>
With a glider gun toolkit, it is possible to construct (reasonably
cost effectively) almost any period glider gun as required.
<P>
With the new tools, the production of additional stages should be a
fairly academic exercise (including a glider stage which can be compressed
to 61 generations).  If it becomes possible to period-indenpendently
process a B-heptomino before its glider is produced or to run through
a series of stages resulting in a B-heptominos, the new tools should allow
for a series of loops lesser than period 61.
<P>
This construction set establishes an upper bound on periods not yet realized
through the life rule.  So the only periods left unresolved at present
(Oct 12, 1996) are 17, 19, 22, 23, 27, 31, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43,
49, 51, 53, 57, and 59 (if this list is incorrect, please let me know).
<P>
Since there are numerous ways to turn a B-heptomino (Herschel) into one
or more gliders (and most of the stages themselves produce gliders), it is
possible to use an open-ended tunnel as a conduit to move gliders to a
specific location quickly.  While this is not exactly a lightspeed wire,
use of an appropriate set of stages is actually close to being a C/3
conduit.  I had already, started some of the work on these stages when Rich
Schroeppel visited in 1995, but was not far enough along to discuss
this concept meaningfully in any context, although I thought the conduit
idea an interesting adjunct to our discussion on the workings of a universal
constructor.
<P>
Personally (let's get a little ego in here), I first imagined the notion
of sheepherding common life objects though tracks in 1973, and it is
really nice to see this come to fruition!  Also on a lesser note, after
many, many false starts a B-heptomino construct finally produced the period
64 glider gun that was thought so trivial so long ago (although it
doesn't look or act like any of us ever thought it would)!
<P>

Now that you have a traffic light stage that can produce a suitable B-heptomino
for use with these tools, it is possible to expand your horizons to
the kind of metamorphosis that will only grow richer with time, since it
is quite trivial to change a B-heptomino to a traffic light at a number of
different points (and I'm sure you'll find many more).
<P>
The R->B conduit should, in fact, lend itself to numerous interesting
possibilities in this area, yielding loops lesser than 61 generations.
Start your engines.
<P>
P.S. everyone
<P>
Have a look at this one, is it a first?
