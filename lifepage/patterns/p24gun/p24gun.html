<P>
On Nov.29, 1994, RWG wrote about his p24 oscillator:
<P>
>Someone will make a gun from this within 24 hrs. [...]
<P>
This was off by three orders of magnitude: it was more like 24 months,
and required a special-order p4 courtesy of DRH's improvement of David
Bell's search program (thanks, Dean!).  The mechanism is not the one
generating a glider directly with the assistance of a vertical spark,
but a more complicated one where two p24's interact with the assistance
of a couple of sparks.  Unable to fit two sparkers to provide them
separately, I finally tried for a single hybrid p4 to supply both the
one-cell spark a la mold and the domino spark one generation later, and
after several day-long searches reached an end that I could finish off
by hand with a pair of toads (as shown here) or eaters.  The resulting
oscillator is an ugly beast that dwarfs the rest of the construction,
and can probably be reduced considerably (quite aside from whittling
down the stator), but at least it works.  Here's the complete gun;
the glider barely escapes past the eater on the left, but if came
too close this eater could be replaced by a figure-8 to delete
the extraneous blinker.

<EM>Subject: p72 guns</EM><BR>
<P>
Is there a known gun of period 72 other than the huge ones obtained from
Herschel loops?  I tried unsuccessfully to produce one by applying a
p72 spark to the p24 oscillator.  But now that we have a p24 gun we
can use the p72 to *delete* every third glider.  Doing this once yields
an intermittent gun of period 72 (which the Herschel guns don't do,
though I suppose the insertion reactions can manufacture it from
several such guns, and aren't restricted to a separation of 24);
of course two p72's can thus be used to get a p72 glider stream,
but it turns out that a single p72 suffices to thin a p24 glider
stream by a factor of three.  Pictures of both follow.

The p24 LWSS gun can be turned on and off by deleting appropriate gliders.
In the off state, two gliders destroy each other and the third can be
eliminated with an eater.  Here's the reaction showing 3 colliding streams of 
6 gliders each:

<P>

The glider stream produced by the LWSS/glider collision
can be turned on and off in a similar fashion by deleting the
glider to turn it off, and the deleting the LWSS to turn it back on.

(Geeze, it seems that some people never look at the stuff I send in:)
<P>
If people had looked at what I sent in a week or so ago on c/3 puffers,
they would have seen a LWSS to MWSS convertion reaction found by Dieter
Leithner a long time ago.  The same reaction used there easily makes a
MWSS stream using three LWSS streams:
<P>
<A HREF="rle2.html"><IMG SRC="rle2.gif"></A>
<P>


Dieter also had a similar smashing reaction which turns MWSS's into HWSS's,
so you can probably make a period 24 HWSS gun from it.  Someone should go
back and check whether his reaction works here.  (I don't feel motivated
enough today to do it.)
<P>

Colliding two p24 glider streams can produce several period outputs,
including period 72 and 96.  The period 72 is a two-on one-off, and
so isn't too wonderful considering the p72 gun shown today.  The p96
gun is real nice, though:
<P>

Finally, the on-off LWSS gun reaction is old news. I found a similar
reaction for p30 LWSS streams a long time ago.

Mostly to Noam:
<P>
Congratulations on the fastest genuine glider gun yet! It is wonderful to
finally have it, especially for gun collectors.
<P>
Your ingenious period-doubling mechanism (p48 glider gun) started me to
look for other such p24-specific multipliers. Two were easy to find,
yielding gun periods of 3 x 24 = 72 and 4 x 24 = 96:

<P>
All types of p24 spaceship guns can be constructed with your new glider
gun. First build a p24 LWSS gun using the fast synthesis of a LWSS by 3
gliders (as Paul already has pointed out). Then hammer on the p24 LWSS
stream with two other p24 LWSS streams to make a p24 MWSS stream. Finally,
hammer on the p24 MWSS stream with four p24 glider streams to transform it
into a p24 HWSS stream. Fortunately, these three basic mechanisms work fast
enough for p24:

  3 gliders -> LWSS (p >= 23)<P>

<P>

  MWSS + 4 gliders -> HWSS (p >=22, found by Peter Rott)<P>
<A HREF="pic6.html"><IMG SRC="pic6.gif" ALIGN=TOP></A>
<P>

The sizes of the p24 MWSS and HWSS guns built in this way are rather 
large. Hopefully, smaller guns can be found which use additional 
oscillators as you suggested. In contrast, all three types of p48 
spaceship guns are reasonably sized. Each can be constructed with only four
copies of the p24 glider gun:

PS: While quickly scanning my mail this morning I saw that David Bell
(David, I always read your mail!) apparently has sent the same or similar
stuff to the above. As I have to wait until tonight for time to study my
mail in detail, I am sending this note as prepared yesterday.

Here are 3 more, based on a 3- collision, with periods 264, 288, and 336.
I think that the p336 is the smallest known gun of its period; the others
are not.
<P>
The p288 and p336 use the blinker eater that I found in April. I couldn't
find a way to use a conventional eater there, but I may have missed
something.
<P>
It's likely that other periods can be obtained by changing the reactions
that occur along the SWward glider stream.  (Paul: Is this something
that your search program could look for?)

Here are a p192 gun and a p216 gun based on a 4- collision.  I think 
they're the smallest known with those periods.
