Above is a period-754 glider gun based on the stable
reflector.  Note that
all periods 754+8n (n>0) can be realized simply
by moving the reflectors farther
apart.  Periods 749+4n can also be realized by placing
two gliders on the path at the same time.  Other kinds of guns can be
made by choosing a different glider to recirculate.
Any sufficiently high period oscillator can be realized by recirculating
gliders through a path of such reflectors and using
eaters to eliminate excess gliders.
