<H1>Period-61 Herschel oscillator</H1>
In this pattern, Buckingham pushes Herschel track constructions to
their ultimate limit, namely
the minimum number of generations between
two Herschels passing through
the same component.  Only the
77-generation flip and the 112-generation right turn
allow this compression to be as low as 61 generations.
To pack Herschels this closely, one must delete all excess
gliders, which would otherwise interfere with the next Herschel
on the track.
