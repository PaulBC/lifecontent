<H1>The Oscillator Problem</H1>
A long-standing open problem in Life has been to show how to build
a period-k oscillator for any positive integer k.
<P>
For all but the smallest values of k, the design process has
traditionally been quite haphazard.
Some kind of random experiment (or blind luck) yields a new pattern
that shows promise of oscillating. 
A human designer then "stabilizes" it through the careful placement
of additional objects, possibly including copies of itself.
The simplest
example of such an oscillator is the queen bee shuttle, a commonly occuring
object that self-destructs in its natural form, but which can
be stabilized between two blocks to form a period-30 oscillator
(see <A HREF="../oscspn2.html">oscspn2.lif</A>).
Some objects can also be "perturbed" by surrounding objects to reproduce
themselves in a manner that they would not naturally.
An example I recently found uses
three eaters to rotate a pi heptomino 180 degrees in 44 turns.  Three
additional eaters rotate it back to the same position, giving us a
<A HREF="osc88.html">period-88 oscillator</A>.
<P>
One can realize new periods by combining known oscillators, but any
such period is necessarily a multiple of its components' periods.  
Thus, infinitely many gaps remain, and each seems at
first glance to require
a distinct mechanism to fill.
Given the rarity of such mechanisms and the ingenuity needed to stabilize
them, the situation looks hopeless without some other ideas.

<H1>Stable reflectors and tracks</H1>
Fortunately, there are at least two systematic methods of
realizing any sufficiently high period.  Both have been
discussed for years, but require patterns
that until recently were hypothetical.
<P>
The first idea is to find a still life that can interact non-destructively
with a glider to produce one or more gliders in another direction.
This pattern,
called a stable reflector, can be used to recirculate one or more gliders
through a closed path.
The time for a complete circuit is adjusted by changing the spacing
of reflectors.  It is possible
in principle to construct new oscillators of any sufficiently high
period by
varying the position of reflectors and the spacing of gliders in the
recirculating stream.  Note that if we use higher-period 
reflectors (such as the period-30 reflector used in Dean Hickerson's
<A HREF="../pusher.html">block pusher</A>) we 
can realize only multiples of that period.
<P>
The second idea is more complicated. 
Certain small active objects, notably the b-heptomino,
produce copies of themselves at different orientations and positions.
These copies are rapidly consumed by chaos, but if the object  can be
"tamed" by an assembly
of still lifes to produce a clean copy of itself, then it can
be sent along "tracks" composed of such assemblies.  If enough
different assemblies are found to shift, rotate, or flip the object,
then many different closed tracks can be constructed to
bring the object back to its original position and orientation.
Moreover, the time to complete a circuit is the sum of the time 
through each component.  Given at least two components with relatively
prime timing and enough additional flexibility, one can construct
closed tracks to realize any sufficiently high total circuit time.
By placing n objects in a track whose time is a multiple of n, it is
also possible to realize even lower periods.  The lower limit
is determined by some minimum required lag time between objects.
Tracks have been built out of objects that are not still lifes, but 
these can only realize a restricted set of periods (see
<A HREF="../track.html">track.lif</A>).
<H1>A stable reflector</H1>
<A HREF="stillref.html"><IMG SRC="stillref.gif"></A>
<P>
Shown above is the fastest known stable reflector.  It is an 
optimized version of the first one ever constructed,
which used essentially the same mechanism. 
Several of the components in this construction will also be
discussed in the next section on David Buckingham's Herschel tracks.
<P>
The atomic components (blocks, eaters, etc.) group naturally into stages,
as follows:
<P>
Stage 0: (Paul Callahan)
<P>
In the initial stage, a glider collides with a block to produce a pi
heptomino.  This explosive collision is "perturbed" by the permanent 
parts of the reflector so that at generation 170, the destroyed block is
restored, a glider is released in the reverse direction, an r-pentomino
is produced some distance from the still lifes, and a beehive is left in 
an awkward position close to the block.  In other words, the first
stage is a still life that realizes the following conversion:
<P>
    glider --> glider + r-pentomino + beehive
<P>
Note that nothing is said about the destroyed block.  Since it has been
restored in precisely the same place, we can think of it as a
permanent part of the assembly.   
This is the trick that gives us the "space" we need to work 
with.  You can't do much with one glider, but you can do a lot with a big
explosion, and that includes finding a way to rebuild the initial 
"explosive charge."
<P>
Stage 1: (David Buckingham)
<P>
The next stage converts the r-pentomino to a pattern called the Herschel,
a 7-cell pattern
produced by the b-heptomino along with a block, after 20 generations.
This is an active pattern that sends off gliders and comes close to
reproducing itself before destroying itself in debris.
<P>
Thus the conversion after this stage (generation 257) is:
<P>
    glider --> glider + Herschel + beehive
<P>
Buckingham very recently found ways to "shepherd" a Herschel through eight
different still life stages, implementing turns, reflections, and translations
of this pattern.  This is exactly the "track" idea mentioned
above.  See the 
<A HREF="#herschel">next section</A> 
for details.

Most of these stages produce gliders as a side effect.  
With enough stages, we can route the Herschel to a position and orientation 
such that it will emit a glider on a path to delete the beehive.
There are infinitely many ways to accomplish this, but
the fastest is the most desirable:
the faster we can delete the beehive, the sooner we can reuse the reflector.
Dean Hickerson found the sequence of stages presented here (the fastest
known) and also designed a special-purpose final stage. 
<P>
Stages 2-6 (David Buckingham):
<P>
These stages route the Herschel to the required diagonal.  We
need only two of Buckingham's eight components.  One flips
and translates the Herschel in 77 moves; the other turns it 90 degrees
and translates it in 64 turns.  Gliders are produced in the process,
some of which must be eaten to avoid a fatal collision.
The one non-standard
still life in the construction was designed by Dean Hickerson, 
and is simply a way
of placing two eater heads where separate eaters would not fit.
<P>
After these stages, we have (generation 257 + 77 + 64 + 64 + 77 + 77 = 616):
<P>
   glider --> 4 gliders + (moved) Herschel + beehive 
<P>
Stage 7 (Dean Hickerson):
<P>
This stage converts the final Herschel into 2 gliders.  At stage 685, a
glider is sent off along a path to destroy the beehive.  Finally, by stage
716, we have two gliders in place of the Herschel.  Or:
<P>
   glider --> 6 gliders + beehive.
<P>
At generation 751, one of the gliders destroys the beehive.  Thus, we have the
clean conversion:
<P>
   glider --> 5 gliders.
<P>
One result of this glider excess is that we can produce several kinds
of glider guns by bouncing gliders between reflectors.  It sounds a little
like one of those designs that pop up sometimes for perpetual motion machines.
But there is no "Law of Conservation of Gliders" so it actually works!
The simplest example is:

<A NAME="herschel"><H1>Herschel tracks</H1></A></A>
The current stable reflector wouldn't work at all if it weren't for
the new Herschel tracks found by David Buckingham.  These 
are used above
to move the Herschel
to the place we wanted it.  If instead we were to
build a track that brings the Herschel back to where it
started, it would follow the track forever, giving us
an oscillator whose period depends on the time around the
track.  In fact, we really get a glider gun most of the
time. We have to go out of our way to suppress the excess gliders.
<P>
There are 8 different track components,
providing a great deal of freedom for
placement and timing of the Herschel.
Track segments that rotate the Herschel can 
be duplicated symmetrically to form a closed track on which it recirculates.  
There are also some asymmetric tracks, several
of which are presented below.
<P>
Buckingham's Herschel components and corresponding delays are
as follows:
a left turn (64), a flip (77), a right turn (112), a translation (117),
a flip (119), a right turn (156), a flip (158), and a left turn (190).
The best way to understand these components is to observe them in action.
Here are the patterns themselves, listed in the same order:

Buckingham used his components to construct a period-61 oscillator as
well as true (not
<A HREF="../p15.html">pseudo</A>) glider guns of period 62 through 69.  
Note that guns are usually considered more interesting than oscillators, since
their conversion to oscillators is straightforward.  
<P>
The time around a closed Herschel track is longer than the
smallest periods we are interested in.  We 
must obtain these periods by placing
multiple Herschels on the same track.  
Buckingham's period-67 gun illustrates this technique elegantly.
<P>
<A HREF="g67.html"><IMG SRC="g67.gif"></A>
<P>
All higher gun periods can be realized using
similar techniques.  Realizable periods
are, however, bounded below by the minimum time between
adjacent Herschels on the track. 
Buckingham was able to reduce this minimum to 61,
but only by suppressing all excess gliders:
<P>
<A HREF="o61.html"><IMG SRC="o61.gif"></A>
<P>
Symmetry is evident in the last two patterns.  This is due to the
standard technique of forming a closed track out of rotated copies
of an open track.  A closed Herschel track need not be symmetric, however, and
an asymmetric track is clearly required if one wishes to build an
odd-period gun using just one Herschel.
Closed tracks consisting of just a few stages can be enumerated
readily using depth first search.  I used such a search to find the following
Herschel-based guns.
<P>
A period-945 gun, which I believe to be the minimum odd period that can
be realized using a single Herschel:
<P>
<A HREF="g945.html"><IMG SRC="g945.gif"></A>
<P>
A period-969 gun, which uses a complicated track consisting of
11 components:
<P>
<A HREF="g969.html"><IMG SRC="g969.gif"></A>
<P>
A period-1246 gun that demonstrates all of Buckingham's components in
the same pattern:
