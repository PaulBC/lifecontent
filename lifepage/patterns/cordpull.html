Diagonal sawtooth with expansion factor 6
Population is unbounded but does not tend to infinity.  Its graph is
a sawtooth function with ever-increasing teeth.  More specifically,
the population in generation  t = 8*6^n - 216  (n >= 2)  is  t/36 + 558,
but the population in generation  32*6^n - 429  (n >= 2)  is only  469.
