<H1>Some alternative 2-state cellular automata</H1>
While the focus of this web page is on Conway's Life, there
are many interesting cellular automata known, including several
that are 2-state with a totalistic Moore-neighborhood rule like Life.
David Bell has explored two of these and has made his
writings available on the web.  These are zip-compressed
ASCII text.

While visiting Nick Gotts
in Aberystwyth, Wales last Autumn, I
spent some time looking at a hexagonal rule that exhibits
some of the interesting properties of Life.  Unlike the above, the
rule is not totalistic, but it is a symmetric 2-state rule.
I posted my results to comp.theory.cell-automata, and have also
made the write-up available on the web:

David Bagley added this rule to his X screen lock program
<A HREF="http://wauug.erols.com/~bagleyd/xlockmore.html">xlockmore</A>.
Run as "xlock -mode life -callahan".
