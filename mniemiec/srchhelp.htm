<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>To search for a specific pattern, perform the following steps:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Select an appropriate <i>Rule</i>. (This is not required when entering
	images in RLE format that include a rule specification, as these
	override the specified rule). "Life" is the default rule. If you are
	not sure which rule is appropriate, select "Any", and all rules will be
	searched.</li>
    <li>Choose the kind of search you want from the <i>Search type</i> list:
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Image</b>:
		This allows search for a pattern that exactly matches its
		image of living and dead cells. Pattern orientation is not
		important. Phase is not important for oscillators or spaceships.
		Extra spaces outside pattern are ignored. The exact pattern must
		be specified (i.e. oscillators and spaceships with their
		sparks).
		<ul>
		    <li>Enter the pattern graphically in your favorite Life
			program (e.g. Golly).</li>
		    <li>Select the pattern, and <i>Copy</i> it to the
			clipboard.</li>
		    <li><i>Paste</i> it into the text box below. (Use your
			browser's <i>Paste</i> function, not the page's
			<i>Paste</i> button.)</li>
		    <li>Several different file formats are recognized (Cells
			(plain text), RLE, Life 1.05, and Life 1.06).</li>
		    <li>Or, enter image manually. Spaces, punctuation and
			line-drawing characters are treated as dead cells, and
			all others as living cells. Avoid using # characters at
			at the start of a line, or ! character anywhere, as these
			may cause the pattern to be interpreted as one of the
			special file formats.</li>
		</ul>
		When using Cells, RLE, or Life 1.05 formats (but not Life 1.06),
		the ? character has special meaning. Cells indicated by ? are
		wildcards - they match either living or dead cells. This allows
		one to search for specific pieces of patterns (e.g. patterns
		with an eater tail on one side, patterns with mold rotors, etc.)
		(Note, however, that using wildcards to match pattern images is
		extremely time-consuming. It is generally faster to combine such
		wildcards with other constraints, using Ultimate search,
		especially when searching for oscillators or spaceships.)</li>
	    <li><b>Simple</b>:
		This is the simplest kind of search, and requires you to specify
		the least amount of detail.
		<ul>
		    <li>Enter pattern name to find. Case is ignored. Spaces,
			and punctuation except periods are also ignored.
			<i>with</i> is treated as equivalent to <i>w</i>.
			If a pattern has multiple names, any one of the names
			may be specified. You can specify multiple names
			separated by semicolons, in which a pattern matching
			any of the names will be matched.</li>
		    <li>This normally searches for an exact name match, but you
			can also include one or more * wildcards. One at the end
			of the name is equivalent to a <i>Begins with</i> search.
			One at the beginning of the name is equivalent to an
			<i>Ends with</i> search. Both used together are
			equivalent to a <i>Contains</i> search.</li>
		</ul></li>
	    <li><b>Advanced</b>:
		This is the most general kind of search, and allows patterns to
		be searched by name and/or other commonly-used qualifiers.
		<ul>
		    <li>Select whether search is for <i>Pattern name</i> or
			<i>File name</i>. Pattern name is the default.</li>
		    <li>Qualify name search by selecting <i>Any</i> to find all
			patterns irrespective of name, <i>Is</i> to match the
			name exactly, or <i>Starts with</i>, <i>Ends with</i> or
			<i>Contains</i> to match part of a name. You can also
			search for all patterns except one of these.</li>
		    <li>Enter name to find. This is the same as in the simple
			search. You may also supply one or more * wildcards.
			You can also supply a ~ wildcard at the start to
			invert the sense of the search; e.g. <i>Is '~*jam*'</i>
			is the same as <i>Doesn't contain 'jam'</i>, and
			<i>Contains 'snake~block~boat'</i> is means <i>Contains
			'snake' but not 'block' or 'boat'</i>.
			(If searching for file names, the path, and any extension
			following a period are ignored, but hyphens are
			not.)</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Category</i> to search only patterns from
			that category, rather than all patterns.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Min. Pop</i> to qualify by a minimum
			population or range of populations that should be
			matched. If a pattern has multiple phases with different
			populations, the lowest population is used for search
			purposes, and is also the criterion used on the rest of
			this site for categorizing objects by population.)</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Max. Pop</i> to qualify by a maximum
			population or range of populations that should be
			matched. Infinitely expanding objects like guns, puffers
			and breeders may have infinite maximum populations.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Min/Max</i> to qualify by the ratio of minimum
			to maximum population, or range of ratios. This will be
			0 for infinitely expanding patterns, and 1 for the empty
			field.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Avg. Pop</i> to qualify by an average
			population or range of populations that should be
			matched. If a pattern has multiple phases with different
			populations, this is the average over all phases.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Velocity</i> to qualify by a specific velocity
			or range of velocities. This applies to spaceships,
			puffers and wick-stretchers; all other categories have
			a velocity of 0. It is always a rational fraction of
			<i>c</i>. You can select a specific direction, or search
			all directions. (Velocity is always measured along the
			major axis of movement; e.g. an oblique (2,1)<i>c</i>/6
			spaceship would be indicated by 2<i>c</i>/6, or more
			simply, <i>c</i>/3.)</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Period</i> to qualify by a period or
			range of periods that should be matched. This applies to
			all categories except still-lifes and pseudo-still-lifes
			(that always have periods of 1). Methuselahs are
			unstable and aren't periodic, so they have no periods.
			For search purposes, however, measurements of their
			period and other oscillating properties (such as
			modulus, heat, volatility, bounding box, etc.) are
			measurements of those properties for their final
			census.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Modulus</i> to qualify by a modulus or
			range of moduli that should be matched. This is usually
			the same as period, but may be period/2 for objects with
			glide symmetry, and may also be period/4 for asymmetric
			objects with 90-degree rotational glide symmetry.
			You can also qualify by modulus compared to period.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Freq.</i> to qualify by a frequency of
			occurrence or range of frequencies to be matched. (If
			you prefer, you can change this to <i>Rarity</i> to
			qualify by rarity (i.e. 1/frequency) instead.) Except
			for a small number of common objects, most objects have
			frequencies of 0, or infinite rarity. This only applies
			to still-lifes and oscillators in the Life rule; all
			other categories are considered to have frequencies or
			rarities of <i>N/A</i> for search purposes.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Gliders</i> to qualify by the specific number
			of gliders needed to synthesize the pattern. You can
			also select <i>Unknown</i> for patterns with no known
			syntheses, <i>Partial</i> for patterns with simple
			syntheses based on an as-yet-unsynthesized predecessors,
			and <i>TBD</i> for patterns for which syntheses are
			planned, but have not yet been attempted, so their
			synthesis status is not yet known. You can also select
			<i>Known</i> for patterns for which syntheses have not
			yet been attempted, but it has been proven that
			syntheses definitely exist using standard techniques.
			(If a pattern is listed as needing a range rather than
			a single number, the lower number is used for search
			purposes.) You can also qualify a pattern by its
			relative cost in gliders compared to 1 glider/bit.
			Finally, if you check the 'Range' check-box, only
			patterns that have have multiple syntheses for several
			related objects with different costs has in gliders
			are selected.</li>
		</ul>
		Most search criteria let you qualify the search by constraining
		a specific numeric property (such as population) in one of
		several ways:
		<ul>
		    <li>= <i>y</i>: The property must be exactly equal to
			number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li>&ne; <i>y</i>: The property must not be exactly equal to
			number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li>&lt; <i>y</i>: The property must be less than but not
			equal to number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li>&le; <i>y</i>: The property must be less than or
			equal to number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li>&gt; <i>y</i>: The property must be more than but not
			equal to number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li>&ge; <i>y</i>: The property must be more than or
			equal to number <i>y</i>.</li>
		    <li><i>x</i> &mdash; <i>y</i>: The property must lie within
			the range bracketed by numbers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
			(e.g. <i>x</i> &le; property &le; <i>y</i>).</li>
		    <li><i>x</i> ~ <i>y</i>: The property must lie outside
			the range bracketed by numbers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
			(e.g. property &lt; <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> &lt; property).</li>
		    <li>In cases where special values like &#8734; or
			<i>Unknown</i> (?) or <i>TBD</i> can occur,
			these can be directly selected from the selection list
			without having to type them in.</li>
		</ul>
		Any field where you need to enter a number gives you great
		flexibility in entering one. You may enter any of the following:
		<ul>
		    <li>An empty field is treated as the default value (which is
			usually zero, except for some mathematical operators
			like multiplication and division).</li>
		    <li>Integers (e.g. 1), real numbers (e.g. 1.5), or
			scientific notation (e.g. 1.5e6).</li>
		    <li>Special fractions &frac14; &frac12; and
			&frac34; mixed numbers like 1&frac12;).</li>
		    <li>Infinity, by typing _ or &#8734; or <i>infinity</i>.</li>
		    <li>Some mathematical constants (<i>e</i>, &#960;,
			&#964;, &#981;).</li>
		    <li>For unknown values, such as gliders for objects without
			synthesis, frequency or rarity for uncommon objects,
			or heat for extremely large spaceships, enter ? or <i>x</i>
			or <i>unknown</i>. (Partial syntheses can be
			specified by forms like <i>x</i>+2.)</li>
		    <li>Some simple algebra (e.g. <i>x</i>+2, 1e6-1,
			2&#960; or 2*&#960; or 2&times;&#960;, 2/3, 3&divide;4,
			&#960;^2, or &#960;&sup2;, &#8730;2, 3&#8730;10, 3!).</li>
		    <li>You can also enter multiple numbers separated by
			semicolons. With = the numbers are joined with <i>or</i>
			(e.g. <i>= 1;2;4</i> means <i>is 1 or 2 or 4</i>). With
			any other comparison type, the numbers are joined with
			<i>and</i> (e.g. <i>&ne; 1;2;4</i> means
			<i>is not 1, and is not 2, and is not 4</i>).
			Specifying multiple numbers for anything other than =
			or &ne; is not likely to be useful (e.g.
			<i>&lt; 1;2;3</i> is the same as <i>&lt; 1</i>).</li>
		</ul></li>
	    <li><b>Detailed</b>:
		For when even the advanced search isn't enough, this option is
		similar, but provides many more less common options, such as
		the following:
		<ul>
		    <li>Select <i>E.F.</i> to qualify by evolutionary factor
			(i.e. the time to stabilize divided by minimum
			population) or or range of evolutionary factors that
			should. This is non-zero only for unstable patterns
			(e.g. methuselahs).</li>
		    <li>Select <i>T.T.S.</i> to qualify by time-to-stabilize
			(i.e. the number of generations it takes the pattern to
			reach a periodic form. This is non-zero only for
			unstable patterns (e.g. methuselahs) and is measured
			from their smallest form.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Heat</i> to qualify by heat (i.e. the
			average number of unstable cells) or range of heats
			that should be matched. It can be infinite for
			expanding patterns like guns, puffers and breeders.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Temperature</i> to qualify by temperature
			(i.e. the heat divided by average population) or range
			of temperatures that should be matched. Unlike heat,
			this value is a meaningful finite value for guns,
			puffers and breeders.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Volatility</i> to qualify by volatility
			(i.e. the number of rotor cells divided by the
			population) or range of volatilities that should be
			matched. This always varies between 0 for still-lifes
			and 1 for phoenixes. This is also 1 for moving and
			expanding patterns.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Strict volatility</i> to qualify by strict
			volatility or range of strict volatilities that should
			be matched. This is similar to normal volatility,
			except it only considers cells as rotors if their
			period is the full period of the oscillator, and not
			some fraction. You can also qualify by how strict
			volatility compares to volatility.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Smallest box</i> to qualify by the smallest
			bounding box that contains the pattern. You must specify
			two numbers (in either order), and both numbers must
			match appropriately (e.g. <i>&lt; 6x4</i> accepts 4x4
			but not 5x5). For patterns with multiple generations
			(e.g. oscillators), this may not necessarily be the size
			of the box in the first generation.</li>
		    <li>Similarly, select <i>Largest box</i> to qualify by the
			largest bounding box. For expanding patterns (e.g. guns,
			puffers, and methuselahs that release gliders), this can
			be infinite.</li>
		    <li>For both of the above, you can select <i>Squareness</i>
			to measure the ratio of height to width. This varies
			from 1 from totally square objects, to almost 0 for very
			long and thin ones, and can be 0 for objects that expand
			infinitely in a straight line.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Symmetry</i> to qualify by the kind of
			symmetry possessed by the pattern. Select the symbol
			whose symmetry matches that of the pattern.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Glide</i> to qualify by the kind of glide
			symmetry for oscillating and moving objects that
			re-appear translated or rotated part way through their
			period.</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Phoenix</i> to show only oscillators or
			spaceships that have no cells that survive (i.e. for
			oscillators, there are no stator cells).</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Flip-flop</i> to show only oscillators whose
			rotor cells die only from under-population (or
			<i>On-off</i>, from over-population).</li>
		    <li>Select <i>Babbling brook</i> to show only oscillators
			whose rotors consist entirely of an open-ended chain
			of cells (or <i>Muttering moat</i>, for a closed-ended
			chain).</li>
		</ul></li>
	    <li><b>Ultimate</b>:
		This is like Detailed, but also allows image searching.
		This is most useful when using image wildcards (e.g. search for
		all still-lifes from 18-20 bits with a protruding eater tail,
		or all oscillators with a mold rotor that aren't period 4).</li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>Choose how you would like the search results displayed:
	<ul>
	    <li id="by">Select <i>Show results by</i> to show results by
		List, or by Stamp page. The stamp view is similar to the image
		stamps used elsewhere on this site, and is more readable, but
		the list view provides much more information, and can show
		more results at once, especially for large objects.</li>
	    <li>Select <i>Show numbers as</i> to determine how numbers are
		displayed. <i>Real</i> displays numbers with decimal places,
		e.g. 1.25. Very large and very small numbers are displayed in
		scientific notation, e.g. 1.25e10. <i>Rational</i> displays
		numbers as fractions, e.g. 5/4. Integers are always just
		displayed as integers, e.g. 42. Numbers too large to display
		in the result list view are always shown in scientific
		notation. Velocity is always shown as rational.</li>
	    <li>Normally, up to 20 results are shown in the list view, but this
		number can be changed by by setting the <i>Maximum results</i>
		field. <span id="fixed">(The stamp view always shows stamps of a
		fixed size, typically 110 to a page, although this may be reduced
		if larger objects are found.)</span></li>
	    <li>Results are normally shown in order of increasing population,
		then period, then name. This can be altered by selecting a
		different value from the <i>Sort results by</i> field. (Items
		with the same modulus or velocity are also sorted by period.)
		The sort direction can be <i>Ascending</i> or
		<i>Descending</i>.</li>
	</ul>
	(Altering any of these fields after a search has been performed will
	immediately re-display the current search results using the new
	display parameters.)</li>
    <li>Press <i>Search</i> to display all patterns that match your search
	criteria.</li>
    <li>The search normally takes one or two seconds. If you specify a
	particularly generic search that can find thousands of matches (e.g.
	<i>Name: Contains e</i>, to find all patterns that contain the letter
	"e"), the search can take considerably longer, and may trigger a browser
	warning about a slow or unresponsive script. Please be patient.</li>
    <li>The search results are displayed as a list of
	patterns<span id="res"> or a stamp page showing images of
	patterns</span>. Clicking on a pattern's name
	<span id="click">or image</span> selects it and displays detailed
	information about it. If the search finds exactly one result (which
	usually happens when one enters an image, or a pattern by name with no
	wildcards), that result is automatically selected.</li>
    <li>In the List view, clicking on a column heading changes the sort order,
	and clicking on a second time reverses the sort direction. If results
	from multiple rules are shown, clicking on a rule's heading collapses
	the results for that rule, allowing access to results from other rules
	(especially if a large number of results have been found). Clicking on
	it a second time re-displays the hidden results.</li>
    <li id="stamp">In the Stamp view, clicking on the top or bottom left
	corners of the stamp behave respectively as Page Up or Page Down to
	scroll through multiple results. Clicking on the bottom right corner
	opens an RLE file of the stamp page itself. If there are multiple result
	pages, one can also scan through them using the navigation buttons above
	the stamp image.</li>
    <li>Once a pattern is selected, information about it is displayed below.
	Select one of the links in the table to view it in the appropriate
	context. For convenience, all links open in new windows, keeping the
	search page up. All patterns may be viewed on pages by category (and
	also size, if using the Life rule), and their synthesis files may be
	viewed directly. Some patterns may have additional options.</li>
    <li>The pattern is displayed graphically below its information. Huge
	patterns are not displayed, to avoid very long browser delays. (The
	only patterns currently affected are the
	<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-17o45">Caterpillar</a> and
	<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-gemini">Gemini</a> spaceships and the
	<a class="i" href="puff.htm#puff-geminoid">Geminoid
	replicators</a><span id="tab">,
	and also the <a class="i" href="rulemn.htm#mn-br">P280 breeder</a> in
	<a class="i" href="rulemn.htm">Niemiec's rule</a></span>.)
	The pattern is shown in a canonical representation (i.e. initial
	generation and specific orientation), which may differ from what was
	originally entered, if the search was by image.</li>
    <li id="launch">Clicking on a pattern that is the result of a successful
	search will open the pattern's synthesis file, in the same way as
	clicking on a pattern link elsewhere on this site.</li>
    <li>The <i>Paste</i> button will paste the pattern, once found, back into
	the image box. The format pasted depends on the <i>Paste as</i>
	selection box: plain text, RLE, Life 1.05, or Life 1.06. These can then
	be copied and pasted into other applications, if desired.</li>
    <li>The <i>Help</i> button brings up this help page.</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />
<a name="tips"></a>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Some helpful search tips:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Normally, the list of patterns searched include all patterns on this
	site that occur in detailed object lists, currently around 10000 items.
	You can also optionally search through around 90000 additional items
	that appear on expanded object stamp pages (i.e. those that include
	2000 or more patterns, without syntheses, 1000 per page). To avoid
	long delays during page loads, this option is on a separate page,
	<a class="i" target="lifesrch" href="lifxsrch.htm">Expanded search</a>.
	On that version of the search page, the inclusion of these additional
	patterns can be enabled by checking the check-box <i>Include expanded
	object lists</i>. If this is disabled, the search will be as limited
	(and as fast) as the regular search.
	<ul>
	    <li>Normal search includes all still-lifes up to 15 bits,
		pseudo-still-lifes up to 16 bits, and period 2 oscillators and
		pseudo-oscillators up to 18 bits.</li>
	    <li>Expanded search includes all still-lifes and pseudo-still-lifes
		up to 18 bits, and period 2 oscillators and
		pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits.</li>
	    <li>Expanded search also includes all symmetric still-lifes and
		pseudo-still-lifes up to 24 bits.</li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>If you get too many results, try to narrow down the search. When
	searching by name, use multiple wildcards. (For example, when looking
	for snakes on candelfrobras, try <i>*snake*frob*</i> rather than just
	<i>*frob*</i>. It can also be helpful to narrow the search by
	specifying a population range.</li>
    <li>If you get too few results, or none at all, try removing one search
	parameter at a time until some results are found.</li>
    <li>Four properties (period, population, gliders, name) are always displayed
	in the search results table. Other properties are only displayed if you
	supply search qualifiers for them, or if you specifically sort based
	on those properties. To include other properties in the table without
	actually constraining them, for most properties it is sufficient to
	just specify &ge; 0 (or even just &ge; alone, as 0 is assumed). This
	will match most things (except non-numeric values like ?, <i>x</i>,
	<i>TBD</i>, and <i>N/A</i>).</li>
    <li>Search speed is increased if you specify specific rules, categories,
	populations, periods, or velocities, as these criteria automatically
	reject entire groups of items without needing to examine each item
	separately. Note that searching by pattern image implicitly selects by
	<i>Max. pop. &ge; (population of the entered image)</i>. (If wildcards
	are used in the image, it also implicitly selects by <i>Population &le;
	(population of the entered image, assuming wildcards are alive)</i>.)
	The fastest search is to search by name for one specific still-life,
	e.g. 12.121; such searches should be virtually instantaneous.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Sometimes, results can be correct, although they may seem confusing or
counter-intuitive:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>When entering numeric expressions, the * for multiplication can
	sometimes be omitted, but not always; omitting it can sometimes yield
	unexpected results. It can always be omitted before
	&#960;, &#964; and &#981; (e.g. 2&#960; is 2*&#960;).
	It can be omitted before <i>e</i> (e.g. 3e^2 is 3*<i>e</i>&sup2;), but
	not if it's followed by + or - (e.g. 4e-2 = 0.04, not 4*<i>e</i>-2).
	It can never be omitted with &#8730;
	(e.g. 4&#8730;2 = fourth root of 2, not 4*&#8730;2). It may also never
	be omitted in any other cases not mentioned here.</li>
    <li>In numeric expressions, implicit multiplication has a higher binding
	precedence than exponentiation. Thus, 4&#960;&sup2; and 4&#960;^2
	are (4*&#960;)&sup2; rather than 4*(&#960;&sup2;). This is
	counter-intuitive (and is, in fact, incorrect) but it is not likely to
	be fixed soon.</li>
    <li>The displayed form of an object is the base canonical form that
	included in the object database. This may differ from what is entered
	via image search. Also, directional objects like spaceships and puffers
	have arbitrary directions and orientations, unlike the images on other
	pages on this site, where they typically move upwards an/or to the
	left.</li>
    <li>Adding additional constraints can sometimes produce <i>more</i>
	results rather than less. This often happens when one constraint
	renders another meaningless, causing it to be ignored. For example,
	when searching for objects with velocity &gt; 0, there are hundreds
	of objects (spaceships and puffers), yet when the search is restricted
	to only still-lifes, there are thousands of results. This is because
	velocity is meaningless for still-lifes, so it is ignored, and all
	still-lifes are found.</li>
    <li>All breeders, constellations and methuselahs in this pattern collection
	are stationary, so they are assumed to have a velocity of 0. While this
	is not always true of such patterns in general, it is sufficient for
	searches here, although this could change in the future as new
	patterns are added to the collection.</li>
    <li>Many properties (such as heat and volatility) are formally defined only
	for periodic patterns, such as oscillators (and, implicitly, still-lifes
	that have heat and volatility zero). Here, these definitions are treated
	asymptotically, as limits as time goes to infinity (e.g.
	lim<sub><i>x</i>&#8592;&#8734;</sub> (statistics from generations
	<i>xp</i> ... 2<i>xp</i>-1, where <i>p</i> is the object's period, or 1
	if the period is not regular). This allows the definitions to be
	seamlessly extended to many other classes of objects:
	<ul>
	    <li>Spaceships are completely volatile (e.g. heat is finite, and
		volatility and strict volatility are 1).</li>
	    <li>Heat and volatility of guns are dominated by their outputs
		(e.g. heat is infinite; volatility is that of their
		outputs, e.g. 1).</li>
	    <li>Heat and volatility of puffers and wick-stretchers are dominated
		by their outputs (e.g. heat is that of the puffer if output is
		all still-lifes, and infinite otherwise; volatility is that of
		the output).</li>
	    <li>Similarly, heat and volatility of breeders are dominated by
		their guns or puffers and they in turn by their outputs.
		(e.g. heat is always infinite (e.g. &#8734; for MMS breeders,
		and &#8734;&sup2; for all others).</li>
	    <li>Temperature for infinitely-expanding patterns can be meaningful
		even if heat is not (e.g. for guns, puffers, and breeders, it
		will be that of their dominating outputs.)</li>
	    <li>Methuselahs are dominated by their final census.</li>
	    <li>Irregular infinitely-expanding patterns (typically in rules
		other than Life) have infinite heat and volatility, zero
		strict volatility, and indeterminate temperature.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>Heat and volatility may be incorrect for some objects in these
	categories: methuselahs, puffers, not quite stable objects.</li>
    <li>Most periodic patterns can be found by image search in any phase.
	However, some large patterns are only listed by their main phases. These
	include expanding patterns (methuselahs, guns, puffers, wick-stretchers
	and breeders), and also the four oscillators with periods 300 and
	higher.</li>
    <li>Huge patterns frequently lack accurate information about certain
	statistics, such as pattern image, average and maximum population, heat,
	large bounding box, etc. (The only patterns currently affected are
	the <a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-17o45">Caterpillar</a> and
	<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-gemini">Gemini</a> spaceships and the
	<a class="i" href="puff.htm#puff-geminoid">Geminoid
	replicators</a>.)</li>
    <li>Wildcard image searches may take an extremely long time, especially if
	the image being searched for is fairly large, and there are no other
	constraints. It is best to use Ultimate Search to apply other
	constraints to narrow the search first.</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />
<a name="browser"></a>
<h2>Browser issues</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>Some browsers display text more widely than others. Sometimes selecting
	search criteria with ranges (&mdash; or ~) causes lines to wrap around.
	For example, with Chrome, this happens with all criteria relating to
	population or boxes, while with Internet Explorer, this happens only
	with squareness. Firefox, Safari and Opera appear to be unaffected.</li>
    <li id="opera">Opera version 9 does not resize the pattern image properly.
	Also, in the list view, when a large number of results are found (for
	example, around 3000 or more), the sort order can be unpredictable.</li>
    <li id="nocan">Older browsers (such as this one) that lack support for HTML
	canvases do not support the stamp view of search results. They also
	display the pattern image using boxes within tables, which is adequate
	but not as nice looking. Also, one cannot click on the pattern image to
	open the pattern file.</li>
    <li>On some browsers, re-loading the page resets all form data. On some
	others, form data is preserved. In any case, search results are not
	preserved.</li>
</ul></p>
