<h2>Breaking news</h2>
<p>The latter half of 2014 has seen a major explosion in the object synthesis
area, so there has not been time to update these pages to keep up with them.
This is a list of some of these discoveries, which will be added here as time
permits:</p>

<p><ul>
    <li>Many oscillators and syntheses have improved syntheses.</li>
    <li>All still-lifes up to 18 bits are proven to have syntheses.</li>
    <li>All flotillae of gliders with arbitrary spacings are proven to have
	syntheses, which makes all the syntheses on these pages involving
	multiple gliders arriving from the same direction robust. (Syntheses
	involving other kinds of spaceships flying in parallel already explicitly
	show syntheses of those spaceships.)</li>
    <li>Syntheses of many exotic spaceships, such as Crab, Dart, Weekender,
	and X66.</li>
    <li>A new fundamental puffer, the Pufferfish, that can be synthesized, and
	can also be turned into a pure spaceship by adding two escort HWSS.</li>
    <li>New Geminoid spaceships</li>
</ul></p>

<hr /><hr />
<a name="news-feat"></a>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>These are some of the main features of these pages:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Complete <a class="i" href="objcount.htm">counts</a> of Life objects up to 21
	bits, with some up to 25 bits.</li>
    <li>Complete lists of most of the above objects.</li>
    <li>Syntheses for most objects up to 21 bits (15 for still-lifes, 16 for
	pseudo-still-lifes, 18 for period 2 oscillators, 17 for period 2
	pseudo-oscillators), and some up to 25 bits, plus selected larger
	objects.</li>
    <li>Above lists are arranged by
	<a class="i" href="objtype.htm">object type</a>,
	<a class="i" href="objsize.htm">size in bits</a>,
	<a class="i" href="objcost.htm">cost in gliders</a>, and
	<a class="i" href="natural.htm">frequency of occurrence</a>, and also by
	<a class="i" href="objname.htm">name</a> for common objects.</li>
    <li>Similar object and synthesis data for several
	<a class="i" href="liferule.htm">cellular automata rules</a> other than Life.</li>
    <li>All objects in the above lists can be directly
	<a class="i" target="lifesrch" href="lifesrch.htm">
	searched</a> by pattern image, name, and/or criteria such as
	population, period, velocity, cost in gliders, and many others.</li>
    <li>All synthesis files for any given stamp image can be downloaded in a
	single zip file, for convenience.</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />
<a name="news-def"></a>
<h2>Deficiencies</h2>
<p>The following are known deficiencies and limitations with these pages:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>While most object lists have syntheses for most objects on those lists,
	there are a small number of objects for which syntheses have been
	attempted, but no suitable synthesis methods have yet been found. These
	await better technology, inspiration, or blind luck.</li>
    <li>Syntheses are only partially complete for
	<a class="i" href="p1-15.htm">15-bit still-lifes</a> and
	<a class="i" href="p2-18.htm">18-bit period 2 oscillators</a>.</li>
    <li>Object list and syntheses are only partially complete for
	<a class="i" href="p3-21.htm">21-bit period 3 oscillators</a>.</li>
    <li>Many lists of objects from 22-25 bits have been counted, but specific
	object lists have not yet been assembled, nor syntheses attempted for
	most of the objects, other than a superficial examination to determine
	which objects would be easy to synthesize using standard methods,
	and which ones would require special treatment, or not have syntheses
	at all.</li>
    <li>Overweight spaceship flotillae have been counted, but not
	explicitly listed nor synthesized. Syntheses have been developed for
	most of them from one side or other, and most of these can be combined
	in pairs, like building blocks, to create the full overweight spaceship
	flotillae, but this has not been done yet.</li>
    <li>Large lists (typically those involving between 1000 and 10000 objects)
	have large stamps of 1000 objects per page, but one cannot click on
	individual objects to see them in detail. These include
	<a class="i" href="p1.htm">still-lifes</a>
	(of <a class="i" href="p1-16.htm">16</a>,
	<a class="i" href="p1-17.htm">17</a> bits) and
	<a class="i" href="p1-18.htm">18</a> bits),
	<a class="i" href="pp1.htm">pseudo-still-lifes</a>
	(of <a class="i" href="p1-17.htm">17</a> and
	<a class="i" href="p1-18.htm">18</a> bits),
	<a class="i" href="p2.htm">period 2 oscillators</a>
	(of <a class="i" href="p2-19.htm">19</a>,
	<a class="i" href="p2-20.htm">20</a> and
	<a class="i" href="p2-21.htm">21</a> bits),
	<a class="i" href="pp2.htm">period 2 pseudo-oscillators</a>
	(of <a class="i" href="pp2-18.htm">18</a>,
	<a class="i" href="pp2-19.htm">19</a>,
	<a class="i" href="pp2-20.htm">20</a> and
	<a class="i" href="pp2-21.htm">21</a> bits).</li>
    <li>Some lists consist entirely (or almost entirely) of a large number of
	objects for which syntheses are unknown, and are extremely unlikely to
	ever be found. Such lists sometimes omit clickable object files for
	objects without syntheses, especially if these objects occur in only
	that one list and nowhere else. These include several lists for the
	<a class="i" href="rule22.htm">B2/S2 rule</a>
	(<a class="i" href="rule22.htm#22-p1">still-lifes</a>,
	<a class="i" href="rule22.htm#22-p2">period 2 oscillators</a> and
	<a class="i" href="rule22.htm#22-btc">billiard tables</a>).
	This does not apply to most explicit list of
	<a class="i" href="glider-u.htm">objects without syntheses</a>
	as these contain objects that already exist on other lists.)</li>
</ul></p>

<a name="news-bug"></a>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>The following are known bugs on these pages. These are specifically things
that are proper HTML, and rendered correctly in most browsers, especially
Chrome, Firefox and Safari, but which displayed incorrectly in Internet Explorer
versions at least up to 10:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Sometimes, in tables with objects of different widths, Internet
	Explorer displays incorrect widths for some objects. The objects are
	in the correct relative positions, but the shapes of their boxes may
	be distorted.</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer sometimes displays boxes for some exotic but valid
	Unicode characters. This affects some mathematical symbols on the
	<a class="i" href="onag.htm">Surreal Numbers and Games page</a>, and its
	related <a class="i" href="onagcalc.htm">calculator page</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Recent changes to these pages</h2>
<p>This is a list of major changes in these pages. Minor fixes,
such as fixed typos, re-worded descriptions, or slightly-improved syntheses
(usually as a result of improved bookkeeping) are not listed:</p>

<p>
<i>2015-02-19</i>
Major site overhaul, including the following, among others:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Total pages:</b> The total number of distinct web pages has almost
	doubled from 65 to 128.</li>
    <li><b>Total stamps:</b> The total number of pattern stamp collections has
	almost tripled from 259 to 736.</li>
    <li><b>Total files:</b> The total number of separate files on the site (most
	of which are synthesis file) has tripled from 3804 to over 12000,
	which includes over 10000 object synthesis .RLE files.</li>
    <li><b>Renamed files:</b> Some existing page and pattern files have been
	renamed, for the sake of simplicity and consistency.</li>
    <li><b>Renamed patterns:</b> Some existing patterns have been renamed, to
	conform to popular usage.</li>
    <li><b>Removed pages:</b> Three pages have been removed, with their contents
	included directly in their parent pages:
	<a class="i" href="bits-13.htm#pp1-13">13-bit pseudo-still-lifes</a>,
	<a class="i" href="bits-15.htm#pp2-15">15-bit P2 pseudo-oscillators</a>,
	<a class="i" href="bits-16.htm#p2-16">16-bit P2 oscillators</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Added pages:</b>
	Changes (this page),
	<a class="i" href="lifemeth.htm">Search methodologies</a>,
	<a class="i" href="lifemap.htm">Site map</a>,
	<a class="i" target="lifesrch" href="lifesrch.htm">
	Search for pattern</a> (and <a class="i" target="srchhelp"
	href="srchhelp.htm">search help</a>),
	<a class="i" href="lifelink.htm">Links and other resources</a>,
	<a class="i" href="gun.htm">Guns</a>,
	<a class="i" href="color.htm">Multi-colored Life</a>,
	<a class="i" href="liferule.htm">Alternate rules</a>
	(including <a class="i" href="rule22.htm">2/2 Life</a>,
	<a class="i" href="rule34.htm">3/4 Life</a>, and
	<a class="i" href="rulemn.htm">Niemiec's rules</a>),
	<a class="i" href="onag.htm">Surreal Numbers and Games</a>
	(plus an <a class="i" href="onagcalc.htm">interactive calculator</a>
	for them).</li>
    <li><b>All object lists:</b> Stamps are in color, and font used to display
	cost in gliders improved. Many lists have additional objects. Color is
	used to categorize objects by ease of synthesis. Most stamps have object
	periods indicated in the top right corner, populations in the bottom
	left corner, and velocity (for moving patterns) or final population
	(for methuselahs) or page number (for large lists) in the bottom
	right corner. If objects of multiple periods, populations or
	velocities appear on one page, they are usually divided into sections
	by period, population, and/or velocity, and have similar indicators
	on each section.</li>
    <li><b>All object pages:</b> Many additional syntheses have been added;
	many existing syntheses have been improved or expanded; several
	incorrect syntheses have been fixed.</li>
    <li><b><a class="i" href="objcount.htm">Object counts</a>:</b> Counts of
	24-bit <a class="i" href="p1.htm">still-lifes</a> and
	<a class="i" href="pp1.htm">pseudo-still-lifes</a> have been fixed
	(a few new items found). New computer search counts for for
	<a class="i" href="p2-21.htm">21-bit period 2 oscillators</a> and
	<a class="i" href="pp2.htm">pseudo-oscillators</a>.
	Computer verified search for
	<a class="i" href="p3-20.htm">20-bit period 3 oscillators</a> and
	<a class="i" href="pp3.htm#pp3-20">pseudo-oscillators</a>.
	All oscillators and pseudo-oscillators expanded to 21 bits
	(25 bits for periods 4 and higher,
	24 bits for period 5 and 6 oscillators and period 15 pseudo-oscillators,
	and 22 bits for period 3 and 4 pseudo-oscillators).</li>
    <li><b><a class="i" href="objcost.htm">Cost in gliders</a>:</b>
	Added new pages for objects constructible from
	<a class="i" href="glider-5.htm">5 gliders</a>,
	<a class="i" href="glider-6.htm">6 gliders</a> and
	<a class="i" href="glider-e.htm">1 glider/bit</a>, as well as
	<a class="i" href="natural.htm">naturally-occurring objects</a>.</li>

	and <a class="i" href="bits-25.htm">25</a> bits,
	one for <a class="i" href="bits-lg.htm">larger objects</a>, and one for
	<a class="i" href="bits-bad.htm">not quite stable objects</a>.</li>
    <li><b><a class="i" href="objtype.htm">Objects sorted by type</a>:</b>
	Most sub-pages include new sub-sections for objects from 21-25 bits,
	larger objects, and <a class="i" href="objcost.htm">costs in gliders</a>.</li>
    <li><b><a class="i" href="p1.htm">Still-lifes</a>:</b>
	Added syntheses for all <a class="i" href="p1-14.htm">14-bit</a>
	and <a class="i" href="p1-15.htm">15-bit</a>* still-lifes,
	plus many larger ones. All still-lifes up to 17 bits can be synthesized.
