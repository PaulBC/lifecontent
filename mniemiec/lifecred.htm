<p>This is a list of most of the individuals whose work is included in these
pages. In most cases, those who have discovered or created object syntheses
are mentioned, but discoverers of individual patterns themselves are not.</p>

<p><i>(NOTE: This list includes only individuals whose work is directly or
indirectly included in these pages. There are many others not included here
who have also made substantial contributions to Life.)</i></p>

<p>Contributors referenced from other pages have individual sections. Others

<a name="ball"></a>
<h2>Josh Ball</h2>
<p>Josh Ball found the <a class="p" href="ss/20lfr.rle">Loafer</a>,
the only known <i>c</i>/7 orthogonal spaceship. What is truly remarkable is its
small size, and its simple form, making it easy to synthesize from gliders. The
synthesis was first created by <a class="j" href="#goucher">Adam P. Goucher</a>
and later improved by <a class="j" href="#merzenich">Matthias Merzenich</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="bell"></a>
<h2>David Ingalls Bell</h2>
<p>David Bell has found many spaceships and puffer trains traveling at
several different velocities.
He collaborated with <a class="j" href="#nivasch">Gabriel Nivasch</a> and
<a class="j" href="#summers">Jason Summers</a> to construct
<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-17o45">Caterpillar</a>, currently the largest
non-trivial Life spaceship.</p>

<p>He has much useful Life information on his
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://members.tip.net.au/~dbell/">web site</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="beluchenko"></a>
<h2>Nicolay Beluchenko</h2>
<p>Nicolay Beluchenko has discovered many medium-sized oscillators, including
<a class="p" href="19/19bw.rle">Bowed caterer</a>,
<a class="p" href="19/19fs.rle">Fire spitting</a>,
<a class="p" href="20/20blonkr.rle">Blonker</a>,
a series of oscillators with an eater eating a thing with various attachments
(like <a class="p" href="20/20nblf.rle">loaf</a> or
<a class="p" href="20/20nbtl.rle">tail</a>),
and <a class="p" href="23/23p6nb.rle">Two eaters eating thing</a>,
as well as three previously-overlooked 20-bit variants of
<a class="p" href="14/14eet.rle">Eater eating eater</a>. He has also done a
computer search completing the list of period 3 oscillators and
pseudo-oscillators up to 20 bits, that also included several never previously
reported.</p>

<hr />
<a name="buckingham"></a>
<h2>David Buckingham</h2>
<p>David Buckingham significantly expanded the lists of known
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a>, first listing the
<a class="i" href="p1-12.htm">12-bit ones</a>
(simultaneously with <a class="j" href="#petrie">Petrie</a> and
Boyer), first listing the <a class="i" href="p1-13.htm">13-bit ones</a>,
and using <a class="j" href="#raynham">Raynham's</a> search program
to first list the <a class="i" href="p1-14.htm">14-bit ones</a>.</p>

<p>He found many <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a>,
including literally hundreds of billiard table configurations, as well as
a basic <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#puff">period 24 puffer train</a>.</p>

<p>He developed most of the existing technology used in glider synthesis of
still-lifes, oscillators, and
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#ss">spaceships</a>, and methodically
generated syntheses of all still-lifes and oscillators up
to 14 bits, as well as many larger ones. Most complex syntheses of larger
objects are heavily based on the tools he developed.</p>

<p>In 1996, he revealed a suite of track components that use eaters and other
still-lifes to move can move a Herschel heptomino - the 20th generation of
<a class="p" href="0/6bh.rle">B heptomino</a>, after it has left a block behind.
By combining several of these, in much the same way as one assembles toy
train tracks, one can produce circular conduits that take arbitrarily long
to cycle a single Herschel. By placing multiple Herschels in such a conduit,
one can obtain oscillators of arbitrarily small periods. (These were
improvements over his earlier track components that used spark-producing
oscillators as stabilizers; unfortunately, those could only produce oscillators
whose periods are multiples of those of the spark-producers.)</p>

<p>Oscillators of all periods 58 and above can be obtained in this way.
Since Herschels naturally release gliders, this also yields glider guns of
all periods 62 and above. (The Herschels collide with each other if closer
than 58 generations apart, and they collide with the escaping gliders if
closer than 62 generations apart.) In the late 1990s,
<a class="j" href="#leithner">Dietrich Leithner</a> extended this technology by
creating oscillators and guns of periods as low as 54.</p>

<p>This is basically a variation of the method described by
<a class="j" href="#conway">Conway</a> in the 1970s to construct
oscillators of arbitrary period using stable glider-reflectors.
(Currently, most known stable glider-reflectors are derived from the above,
turning a glider into a Herschel, shuttling the Herschel, and then turning
the Herschel back into a glider; unfortunately, the minimum inter-glider
spacing of all known reflectors is much larger than the typical minimal
inter-Herschel spacing (58) of the Herschel conduits.)</p>

<hr />
<a name="callahan"></a>
<h2>Paul Callahan</h2>
<p>Paul Callahan has expanded <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a>
Herschel conduit mechanisms, building stable glider reflectors.</p>

<p>He used to maintain a Life-related web site featuring a comprehensive pattern
catalog and Java life applet, This page is now defunct, but is is currently
archived on
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://radicaleye.com/lifepage/">Tom Rokicki's site</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="coe"></a>
<h2>Tim Coe</h2>
<p>Tim Coe found the
<a class="p" href="ss/28coelw.rle">period 16 puffer engine</a>,
that is itself a clean <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#ss">spaceship</a>,
but that has easily ignitable exhaust, facilitating construction of many
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#puff">puffer trains</a>.</p>

<p>He has also discovered a small
<a class="p" href="17/17tc.rle">P8 oscillator</a>,
a <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal spaceship
(the <a class="p" href="ss/128snail.rle">Snail</a>),
and a collision of 11 gliders that develops into a natural
<a class="p" href="12/12ca.rle">Caterer</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="conway"></a>
<h2>John Horton Conway</h2>
<p>In the early 1970s, John Horton Conway invented the
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#life">Game of Life</a>.
He did much of the original research into Life, laying most of the game's
basic mathematical foundations.</p>

<p>He found many of the small
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a>,
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a>
(including the <a class="p" href="lg/48pu.rle">Pulsar</a> and
<a class="p" href="12/12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>), and
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#ss">spaceships</a>
(<a class="p" href="ss/5gl.rle">Glider</a>,
<a class="p" href="ss/9lw.rle">Light-weight spaceship (LWSS)</a>,
<a class="p" href="ss/11mw.rle">Middle-weight spaceship (MWSS)</a>, and
<a class="p" href="ss/13hw.rle">Heavy-weight spaceship (HWSS)</a>.)</p>

<hr />
<a name="corderman"></a>
<h2>Charles Corderman</h2>
<p>Charles Corderman discovered the 9-bit still-life
<a class="p" href="0/9-10.rle">hat</a> and the
<a class="p" href="0/8sw.rle">Switch Engine</a>, the only known simple
naturally-occurring puffer train, as well as three stabilized variants of it
(<a class="p" href="ss/12swbk.rle">block-making</a>,
<a class="p" href="ss/12swgl.rle">glider-making</a>,
and <a class="p" href="ss/16na.rle">Noah's ark</a>).</p>

<hr />
<a name="eisenmann"></a>
<h2>Jack Eisenmann</h2>
<p>Jack Eisenmann has done much exploration of the
<a class="i" href="rule34.htm">B34/S34 rule (3/4-Life)</a>.
He has found most of the non-trivial spaceships, and many of the larger
oscillators of several periods.</p>

<p>He maintains an extensive set of information about this rule on his
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://www.ostracodfiles.com/34life/main.html">web site</a>.
</p>

<hr />
<a name="elkies"></a>
<h2>Noam Elkies</h2>
<p>Noam Elkies has found several oscillators, including the period 36
<a class="p" href="22/22et2t2.rle">Two eaters hassling two T tetrominos</a>,
a small <a class="p" href="20/20ne.rle">period 5 oscillator</a>,
and the infinitely expandible Traffic jam oscillators.</p>

<p>He has also proven that the density of Life still-lifes
cannot exceed 50%.</p>

<hr />
<a name="eppstein"></a>
<h2>David Eppstein</h2>
<p>David Eppstein has found many spaceships traveling at many different
velocities, in Life and many other cellular automata. Most notably, on
2000-01-12, he found the <a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-2o7">Weekender</a>, the
first known Life spaceship that moves orthogonally at a velocity of
2<i>c</i>/7.</p>

<p>He maintains an extensive web site dealing with
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/ca/">
gliders in all Life-like rules</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="flammenkamp"></a>
<h2>Achim Flammenkamp</h2>
<p>Achim Flammenkamp performed many experiments on random Life fields,
collecting statistics on object artificiality. In the process,
he found many never-before-seen naturally-occurring (though extremely rare)
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a>,
such as the P4 <a class="p" href="lg/40clover.rle">Cloverleaf</a>,
the P5 <a class="p" href="15/15ap.rle">Pseudo-barber-pole</a>,
the P8 <a class="p" href="17/17sm.rle">Smiley</a>, another
<a class="p" href="18/18p8af.rle">P8</a>, a
<a class="p" href="lg/72p11af.rle">P11</a>, a
<a class="p" href="lg/32p16af.rle">P16</a>, and a
<a class="p" href="lg/42p144af.rle">P144</a>.</p>

<p>His results are available on his
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/~achim/gol.html">
web site</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="gosper"></a>
<h2>R. William Gosper</h2>
<p>Bill Gosper found some of Life's basic shuttle-based oscillators,
including <a class="p" href="20/20bqbbk1.rle">Queen Bee</a>,
<a class="p" href="lg/43p46tw.rle">Twin Bees</a>, and
<a class="p" href="lg/70p100ce.rle">Centinal</a>.
He first proved that Life patterns could expand forever by constructing the
first <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#gun">glider gun</a>, and subsequently a
<a class="p" href="ss/p20rwg2.rle">period 20 puffer train</a>.
He subsequently also proved that Life patterns could expand quadratically
by constructing the first <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#breeder">breeder</a>,
by having a flotilla of puffers that construct glider guns.</p>

<hr />
<a name="goucher"></a>
<h2>Adam P. Goucher</h2>
<p>Adam P. Goucher was the first to synthesize the
<a class="p" href="ss/20lfr.rle">Loafer</a>.</p>

<p>In July 2014, he completed work on the
<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-hbk">Half-baked knight-ship</a>, a series of
spaceships of any velocity (2,1)<i>c</i>/<i>k</i> for any sufficiently
large <i>k</i> (e.g. around 2400000 or larger). This is based on a remarkable
interaction where a glider hits a half-bakery, shifting the half-bakery (3,6)
cells, and shifting the glider one row.</p>

<p>He maintains the <a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://pentadecathlon.com/">
Game of Life portal</a> with <a class="j" href="#greene">Dave Greene</a> and
<a class="j" href="#koenig">H. Koenig</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="grant"></a>
<h2>Martin Grant</h2>
<p>Martin Grant (aka "Extrementhusiast") was the first to synthesize

the <a class="p" href="25/25b1gl.rle">Bellman 1 glider eater</a>,
<a class="p" href="lg/30scbg4.rle">Spark coil w/4 barges</a>, and
the <a class="p" href="lg/39ve3lf.rle">Variant eater-3</a>,
and reduced syntheses of
<a class="p" href="17/17tc.rle">Coe's P8</a> and
<a class="p" href="lg/28be2be2.rle">Two pairs of bookends</a>,
and helped complete syntheses of the last two unsolved
<a class="i" href="p1-15.htm">15-bit still-lifes</a>
(<a class="p" href="15/15-387.rle">15.387</a> and
<a class="p" href="15/15-390.rle">15.390</a>), and the last unsolved
<a class="i" href="pp1-16.htm">16-bit pseudo-still-life</a>
(<a class="p" href="16/16htht8.rle">down hook w/tail below hook w/tail)</a>),
three problems that had been unsolved for a decade and a half. He was also
instrumental in completing the syntheses of many of the last unsolved
<a class="i" href="p1-16.htm#p1-16-a">16</a>,
<a class="i" href="p1-17.htm#p1-17-a">17</a>, and

<h2>David Greene</h2>
<p>David Greene constructed a knight-ship based on
<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p>He maintains the <a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://pentadecathlon.com/">
Game of Life portal</a> with <a class="j" href="#goucher">Adam Goucher</a> and
<a class="j" href="#koenig">H. Koenig</a>.</p>

<p>He is one of the co-authors of Golly, one of the most popular Windows-based
Life programs, along with
<a class="j" href="#rokicki">Tomas Rokicki</a>,
<a class="j" href="#trevorrow">Andrew Trevorrow</a>,
<a class="j" href="#summers">Jason Summers</a>, and Tim Hutton.</p>

<a name="hensel"></a>
<h2>Alan Hensel</h2>
<p>Alan Hensel maintains a
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/life/">web site</a>
that includes a comprehensive glossary of Life patterns and terms.</p>

<hr />
<a name="hickerson"></a>
<h2>Dean Hickerson</h2>
<p>Dean Hickerson wrote the first oscillator search program, that
found many new <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a>,
including some small ones like the <a class="p" href="12/12ca.rle">Caterer</a>,
<a class="p" href="12/12md.rle">Mold</a> and
<a class="p" href="13/13jm.rle">Jam</a> (that had been previously found by
<a class="j" href="#flammenkamp">Achim Flammenkamp</a> but were not well known).
This program also found the first spaceships other than the four natural ones
found by <a class="j" href="#conway">Conway</a>.</p>

<p>He has also written another search program that has found many
new billiard table oscillators, including the first period 17, and
created many patterns whose population growth are neither linear nor
quadratic, for example, <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>), <i>O</i>(&#8730;<i>n</i>),
<i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) etc.</p>

<p>He also found glider syntheses of several large objects that
occur naturally in contrived situations, as well as the first
four-glider synthesis of the <a class="p" href="0/8tt.rle">tub w/tail</a>.</p>

<p>Most recently, he has created a search program that has searched through
many random collisions of four gliders, finding many
<a class="i" href="glider-4.htm">four glider syntheses</a> of common objects,
plus several larger ones.</p>

<p>He used to maintain a Life-related web site featuring many oscillators and
glider syntheses. This page is now defunct, but is is currently archived on
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://radicaleye.com/DRH/life.html">Tom Rokicki's site</a>.

<a name="holzwart"></a>
<h2>Hartmut Holzwart</h2>
<p>Hartmut Holzwart found many exotic spaceships and spaceship tag-alongs,
including the <a class="i" href="flotilla.htm#ss-4h">hive-nudgers</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="koenig"></a>
<h2>H. Koenig</h2>
<p>H. Koenig has performed many computer object searches, verifying
<a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> and
<a class="j" href="#niemiec">Niemiec's</a>
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-life</a> counts up to 18 bits,
and period 2 <a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a>
up to 16 bits, (as well as making several minor corrections to some of these
lists.), and period 2 oscillators up to 20 bits.</p>

<p>He has collected statistics on many randomly-occurring Life objects and
oscillators, the results of which have resulted in improved glider syntheses
of some of these. He has also found a previously-unknown three-glider synthesis
of the <a class="p" href="12/12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>.</p>

<p>He has a large <a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://pentadecathlon.com/">
Game of Life portal</a> that he maintains along with
<a class="j" href="#goucher">Adam Goucher</a> and
<a class="j" href="#greene">Dave Greene</a>,
that includes lists of objects and many glider syntheses,
an alternative to much of the information contained here.</p>

<hr />
<a name="leithner"></a>
<h2>Dietrich Leithner</h2>
<p>Dietrich Leithner and his friend Peter Rott extended
<a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> Herschel-conduit oscillator
technology by creating oscillators and guns of periods as low as 54. He also
created the first gliderless <a class="i" href="gun.htm">gun</a> that produces
<a class="p" href="ss/9lw.rle">light-weight spaceships</a>.</p>

<hr />
<a name="merzenich"></a>
<h2>Matthias Merzenich</h2>
<p>Matthias Merzenich (aka "Sokwe") has found several oscillators, including a
<a class="p" href="24/24p10mm.rle">24-bit period 10</a>, and
<a class="p" href="lg/36et4hf.rle">Honey thieves</a>, the first
glider-constructible period 17, as well as a
<a class="i" href="exotic.htm#ss-o7">83-bit <i>c</i>/7 diagonal spaceship [x]</a>
that can also push multiple copies of its own head.
He helped develop syntheses for
<a class="p" href="lg/29-1.rle">29-bit still-life #1</a>

<a class="p" href="lg/68p32-1.rle">period 32</a> and a

<a class="p" href="ss/28hbkm.rle">HWSS and MWSS dragging block</a> and
<a class="p" href="lg/40clover.rle">Cloverleaf</a>. He was also instrumental in
completing the syntheses of many of the last unsolved
<a class="i" href="p1-16.htm#p1-16-a">16</a>,
<a class="i" href="p1-17.htm#p1-17-a">17</a>, and

<h2>Mark D. Niemiec</h2>
<p>Mark D. Niemiec has found several oscillators, including the
period 9 <a class="p" href="lg/40sret4.rle">Snacker</a>
(with <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham</a>).</p>

<p>He expanded on <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a>
enumeration results, generating complete lists of
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a> and
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#pp1">pseudo-still-lifes</a>
up to 24 bits, as well as period 2
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#osc">oscillators</a> and
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#posc">pseudo-oscillators</a>
up to 21 bits.
He has also listed larger-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to
20-24 bits by hand, although these still await computer verification;
many of these were assembled from lists compiled by
<a class="j" href="#hickerson">Dean Hickerson</a>,
<a class="j" href="#koenig">H. Koenig</a> and others.</p>

<p>He has expanded on <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> glider
synthesis results, generating syntheses of almost all 15-bit still-lifes,
pseudo-still-lifes up to 16 bits, many remaining period 2 oscillators of
15-18 bits, most period 2 pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits,
and most higher-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 21-24 bits.</p>

<p>He is also the author and maintainer of these Life pages, that show
many of the above object lists and syntheses.</p>

<p>He has most recently written a search program that applies lists of known
synthesis recipe fragments to list of objects to create recipes for creating
most objects, as well as lists of objects that can or be synthesized from
known recipes. This makes it possible to find automated synthesis paths for
most small objects for which syntheses have not yet been attempted, and to
reduce large lists of objects to much smaller lists of objects for which no
automated syntheses are yet known - making it easier to focus research on
those few difficult objects.</p>

<a class="p" href="ss/12swbk.rle">Switch engine</a>.</p>

<p>He and V. Everett Boyer also first listed the 12-bit
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a>,
(simultaneously with <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham</a>).</p>

<a name="playle"></a>
<h2>Mike Playle</h2>
<p>Mike Playle created a search engine called Bellman whose purpose is to
find highly customized still-lifes that are useful for eating and hassling.
It found several useful mechanisms. One of these is
<a class="p" href="lg/31b1tl.rle">Bellman One (B1) traffic-light eater</a>.
Another is the <a class="p" href="lg/49snref.rle">Snark</a>, a glider reflector
with a very fast recovery time, reflecting gliders spaced as close as 43
generations apart by 90 degrees. This allows creation of oscillators of all
periods 43 and above, and created the first oscillators ever seen with periods
43 and 53.</p>

<a name="raynham"></a>
<h2>Peter R. Raynham</h2>
<p>Peter R. Raynham has found several small oscillators.</p>

and the previous optimal (for twenty years) four-glider synthesis of the
<a class="p" href="12/12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>.</p>

<p>He wrote the first program to search for
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a>,
verifying the lists created by <a class="j" href="#wainwright">Wainwright</a>
and <a class="j" href="#buckingham">Buckingham</a>, and that Buckingham used
to expand the state of the art to include the
<a class="i" href="p1-14.htm">14-bit still-lifes</a>.
That program's algorithm inspired <a class="j" href="#niemiec">Niemiec's</a>
program that enumerated the larger <a class="i" href="p1.htm">still-lifes</a>
and <a class="i" href="p2.htm">period 2 oscillators</a>.</p>

<h2>Robert T. Wainwright</h2>
<p>In the early 1970s, Robert T. Wainwright published Lifeline,
a newsletter devoted to discoveries about
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#life">Life</a>, and sometimes other similar
cellular automata. Many of the original discoveries in Life were first published
in Lifeline, and Lifeline served to foster much interest in Life, that was then
still in its infancy.</p>

<p>Wainwright began the first efforts to systematically list the
<a class="i" href="lifeterm.htm#p1">still-lifes</a>, assembling lists up to
