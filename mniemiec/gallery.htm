	<td><p>In February 1989, I started a tower in my office, made out of
	empty Coke cans. Such towers tend to be fairly sturdy, since the bases
	of one level are held firmly in place by the pull-tabs on the next lower
	level. By Christmas, it had reached 10 complete levels (385 cans),
	so I put a star on top to make a Christmas Tree.</p>
	<p>In March 1990, when L&aacute;szl&oacute; came in for a job interview,
	he insisted that somebody need to throw a football at the tower,
	so when he was hired, I promised him the honor of doing so.</p>
	<p>In September, the tower had penetrated the ceiling, 14 cans high and
	11 wide (with a corner missing, due to the width of the table), a total
	of 960 cans. We got out the camera and cam-corder for the tearing-down
	ceremony, and L&aacute;szl&oacute; threw the football. Only 2-3 cans
	fell. He then put two phone books in to a box, and tried again. This
	photo is the result. I was lucky to catch the box just after it hit
	the cans before any had actually fallen. Afterwards, it took about a
	minute for the falling cans to settle. The remains filled seven garbage
	bags. (Sadly, only the two bags of aluminum cans were accepted for
	recycling; the five bags of steel cans were not.)</p></td>

	<td><p>I took this around 11 AM on March 16 1991. It is a view directly
	south at the Mayfield/I-271 interchange on Cleveland's east side. This
	photograph as such would now be impossible to take, since express lanes
	have were added in the middle of the I-271 in 1994. The photo was taken
	from a Cessna, that was being piloted by L&aacute;szl&oacute;.</p></td>
