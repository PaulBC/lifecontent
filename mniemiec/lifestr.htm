<a name="purpose"></a>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of these Life pages is twofold.
First, to provide comprehensive lists of Life objects in various categories,
either generated by computer, or assembled by hand but believed to be complete.
These include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
    <li>Still-lifes and pseudo-still-lifes up to 24 bits, generated by
	computer. (Due to space limitations, 16- through 18-bit still-lifes and
	17- through 18-bit pseudo-still-lifes are shown in small size, while
	19- through 24-bit still-lifes and pseudo-still-lifes are counted but
	not shown.)</li>
    <li>Period-2 oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits, generated by
	computer. (Due to space limitations, 19- through 21-bit oscillators and
	18- through 21- bit pseudo-oscillators are shown in small size.)</li>
    <li>Period-3 oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 20 bits, generated by
	computer, and 21-bits generated by hand.</li>
    <li>Higher-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits,
	generated by hand. Some go as high as 25 bits, although some of the
	larger lists are counted but not show.</li>
    <li>Spaceships and pseudo-spaceships up to 25 bits.</li>
    <li>Small two- and three-component spaceship flotillae.</li>
    <li>Some sample exotic spaceships of all known velocities.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Second, to provide full syntheses from gliders of all (or at least most)
Life objects mentioned above, plus some larger ones.
Most of these are in place; at present, some of these are limited:
<ul>
    <li>Still-lifes are complete up to 14 bits. About half the 15-bit ones
	have been instantiated so far. Syntheses are known for all 16-bit ones,
	and all but 21 17-bit ones.</li>
    <li>Pseudo-still-lifes are complete up to 16 bits. All have been
	synthesized. Syntheses are known for all 17-bit ones, all but 8 18-bit
	ones, all but 11 19-bit ones, and all but 97 20-bit ones.</li>
    <li>Period 2 oscillators are complete up to 17 bits (except a few that
	are beyond present technology). About 20% of the 18-bit ones are
	also finished. All but around 45 can be synthesized.</li>
    <li>Period 2 pseudo-oscillators are complete up to 17 bits. Syntheses
	are known for all up to 21 bits except for four non-trivial 21-bit
	ones, plus an additional 4 19-bit, 25 20-bit, and 169 21-bit ones,
	all of which consist of adding a trivial 4-6 bit object to an
	as-yet-unsynthesized 15-17-bit period 2 oscillator.</li>
    <li>Period 3 oscillators are complete up to 20 bits (except 10 that are
	beyond present technology). About 1/6 of the 21-bit ones have been
	instantiated so far; all but 4 of those can be synthesized.</li>
    <li>Period 4 and higher oscillators and pseudo-oscillators are complete up
	to 21 bits (except one period 4 oscillator beyond present technology).
	Many of the larger periods go as high as 25 bits.</li>
    <li>Spaceships and pseudo-spaceships are complete up to 25 bits. All except
	three exotic ones can be synthesized.</li>
    <li>Basic two-spaceship flotillae made from basic <i>c</i>/2 orthogonal
	spaceship components are shown, as well as methods for constructing
	all (but 1) 3-spaceship flotillae, and most larger ones.</li>
    <li>Syntheses for some larger objects are also included. Some of these
	syntheses were generated as intermediate steps for smaller objects;
	some illustrate construction techniques that never occur for smaller
	objects; some are highly unusual objects that occur from symmetrical
	collisions of gliders. However, no attempt is being made to
	systematically synthesize larger objects. Nevertheless, computer
	searches have verified that most larger low-period objects examined can
	be synthesized from existing smaller ones using the same techniques.
	This includes around 96% of still-lifes and 99.7% of pseudo-still-lifes
	up to 24 bits, and 95% of period 2 oscillators and 99.96% of period 2
	pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Most of these have known syntheses. Furthermore, most of the still-lifes
and pseudo-still-lifes, as well as most of the smaller oscillators, can be
synthesized at a cost of no more than one glider/bit.</p>

<p>Because the lists of objects and lists of syntheses are almost identical,
one list is used for both, with links from the list-pages pointing to the
syntheses. For readablity, most such lists are displayed on stamp-pages
up to 100 items per page (10x10, or fewer for larger objects, although a few
lists of up to 110 items are shown on a single page). Lists for
which systematic syntheses have not yet been attempted are provided in a
similar format, but without syntheses; these are frequently accompanied by
smaller lists of subsets of objects for which syntheses have been found. Much
larger lists (1000-25000 objects) are shown on large stamp pages with 1000
items per page (30x34). Lists with more than 25000 items are not shown. Also
not shown are lists for most pseudo-objects above 21 bits; most of these have
been counted, but the generation and formatting of these lists must be done
by hand, and is slow and tedious.</p>

<hr />
<a name="life"></a>
<h2>Life Page</h2>
<p>The top-level Life page provides access to various miscellaneous documents
(such as this one), as well as direct access to second-level
<a class="j" href="#index">index</a> and third-level
<a class="j" href="#list">list</a> pages.</p>

<hr />
<a name="index"></a>
<h2>Indices</h2>
<p>The second-level Life index pages provides direct access to third-level
<a class="j" href="#list">list</a> pages,
and also to to individual sub-sections of those pages.
The indices are sorted and counted in several different ways:
<ul>
    <li>Matrix of object sizes vs. objects types, showing
	<a class="i" href="objcount.htm">counts</a>
	of objects of each kind and size.</li>
    <li>Lists of objects sorted by cost of synthesis in
	<a class="i" href="objsize.htm">gliders</a>,
	then sub-indexed by object types.</li>
    <li>Lists of common objects sorted alphabetically by
	<a class="i" href="objname.htm">name</a> (i.e. a glossary).</li>
    <li>Lists of <a class="i" href="natural.htm">naturally-occurring objects</a>
	sorted by type, then in order of decreasing
	frequency of occurrence.</li>
    <li>Lists of objects sorted by <a class="i" href="objsize.htm">size</a>,
	then sub-indexed by object types.</li>
    <li>Lists of objects sorted by <a class="i" href="objtype.htm">type</a>,
	then sub-indexed by object size (some also by cost in gliders).</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />
<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Object lists</h2>
<p>The third-level Life pages are lists of Life objects
sorted by size, type, or cost.</p>

<p>Each category contains a stamp-page image showing all objects in the
category, with a small number in each object's top/left corner indicating the
minimum number of gliders that are required to synthesize the object.
(If no synthesis is known, an <i>x</i> is shown instead. If the object can be
synthesized, but only from an as-yet-unsynthesized component, <i>x</i>+<i>n</i>
is shown, where <i>n</i> is the number of additional gliders added to the
base component.) Clicking on any object within the stamp-page brings up the
<a class="j" href="#synthesis">object synthesis</a> RLE pattern file associated
with that object. For objects without syntheses, this file contains only the
object. For objects with only partial syntheses, the file shows the synthesis
beginning with the base component.</p>

<p>In most cases (i.e. those in which all the objects on the page are of the
same period), the period is indicated by a number in grey at the top right
corner. For some lists that include multiple groups of periods (e.g. on the
<a class="i" href="osc.htm">oscillator</a> and
<a class="i" href="posc.htm">pseudo-oscillator</a> pages), stamps are
divided into period groups with each group having a period annotation.</p>

<p>Clicking on the top right corner of a stamp-page image downloads all the
RLE files on the page in a single ZIP file, for convenience. If the stamp is
part of a large list that is broken into multiple pieces due to its large size
(typically if it has more than 110 objects), all stamp-page images will download
one ZIP file that contains all syntheses in the list.</p>

<p>Clicking on the bottom right corner of the stamp-page loads the
<a class="j" href="#image">image file</a> of the stamp-page itself. (This includes all
the objects on the page, but does not include any non-Life annotations, like
the numbers indicating the minimum number of gliders required for synthesis.)
For convenience in navigation, clicking on the top left corner jumps to the
top of the page, while clicking on the bottom left corner jumps to the bottom
of the page.</p>

<p>For larger stamp pages, without numbers associated with each sub-pattern,
selecting the stamp-page or any part of it brings up the image-file of the
stamp-page itself. In such cases, individual RLE files or ZIP collections
are not available.</p>

<p>Underneath many of the smaller stamp-pages is a matrix showing the names
of the objects (with the number of gliders in [brackets]) in the same
arrangement as they are in the stamp-page, allowing objects to be easily
accessed by name, or from older browsers. (The larger lists omit the names.)</p>

<p>Some objects (mostly larger <a class="i" href="period.htm">oscillators</a> and
<a class="i" href="gun.htm">guns</a>) are listed by function, rather than by form.
In some such cases, multiple variants may be synthesized; the number in
brackets may include a range of numbers, that usually includes the cheapest
version, as well as the smallest version (that is often more expensive).
This is done most frequently when a single base synthesis path generates
many similar "isomers" of the same object. If different isomers require
different synthesis paths, they are usually listed separately. Several large
oscillators, most frequently billiard tables, will attempt to include at least
two isomers - one with the smallest population that can be currently
synthesized, and one with the smallest cost in gliders. Sometimes even smaller
ones exist for which no synthesis yet exists; these are not listed.</p>

<p>Lists that won't fit in a single stamp page (typically those that have more
than a hundred objects or so) have their own pages, and are broken down into
sub stamp-pages of typically 100 objects per page. The largest lists (for
example, 16 and 17 bit still-lifes) show objects as small as possible, with 1000
objects per stamp (and no associated synthesis files). All such lists also
include a stamp page at the top showing some selected objects that have known
syntheses. Lists with more than 25000 objects are not shown, due to their
size.</p>

<p>Lists of still-lifes have been compiled by
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#conway">Conway</a> (4-7 bits),
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#wainwright">Wainwright</a> (8-11 bits),
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#buckingham">Buckingham</a> (12-13 bits),
Buckingham+<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#raynham">Raynham</a> (14 bits), and
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#niemiec">Niemiec</a> (15-24 bits).</p>

<p>Lists of pseudo-still-lifes (8-24 bits) have been compiled by Niemiec.</p>

<p>Lists of period 2 oscillators have been compiled by Conway (3-11 bits),
Buckingham (12-14 bits), and Niemiec (15-25 bits, as well as corresponding
pseudo-oscillators).</p>

<p>Lists of period 3 oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits have been
compiled by Niemiec, and finally verified and completed up to 20 bits based on lists
provided by <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#beluchenko">Beluchenko</a>.</p>

<p>List of other larger-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators have been
compiled by hand by Niemiec (12-21 bits, some as high as 25 bits),
although most of the oscillators (or at least their basic forms) have been
found by others. These hand-compiled lists are believed to be fairly
complete, although their accuracy has not been verified by computer.
Many of the exotic 21-25-bit oscillators (i.e., those that are not trivial
extensions of smaller ones) came from lists maintained by
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#koenig">Koenig</a>.</p>

<p>Lists of still-lifes (12-18 bits), period 2 oscillators (12-16 bits),
period 3 oscillators (12-14 bits) and period 4 oscillators (12 bits) have
also been computer-verified by
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#koenig">Koenig</a>.</p>

<p>(Most of the oscillators and smaller still-lifes were found long ago,
by many different people; the lists above merely describe the first
systematic attempts to generate complete lists of these objects.)</p>

<hr />
<a name="synthesis"></a>
<h2>Object Synthesis</h2>
<p>The fourth-level Life pages are <a class="j" href="#image">image</a> files
describing syntheses of the object from
<a class="p" href="ss/5gl.rle">gliders</a>. All show at least the synthesis
using the least number of gliders currently known. Many also include alternate
mechanisms. Sometimes the other basic spaceships are also used
(<a class="p" href="ss/9lw.rle">LWSS</a>,
<a class="p" href="ss/11mw.rle">MWSS</a>, and
<a class="p" href="ss/13hw.rle">HWSS</a>), that can all be made from three
gliders. If larger multi-spaceship flotillae are required in a synthesis, or
nearby spaceships (other than gliders) moving in tandem, syntheses of those are
explicitly shown as well.</p>

<p>Frequently-occurring objects (typically from 2-3 gliders) show several
different syntheses. If there are a large number of these, only a few typical
examples are shown.</p>

<p>Objects whose synthesis methods have evolved significantly often show
several of the obsoleted methods, especially if the methods are radically
different, or are still useful in other circumstances.</p>

<p>Objects composed of several parts, especially pseudo-objects, usually also
show incremental syntheses where the pieces are built in any order,
wherever possible. This permits the mechanisms to be used for related larger
objects and pseudo-objects, starting from any given point.</p>

<p>Each step is shown in two parts: a <i>before</i> part shown using default
cell-state #1, and an <i>after</i> part shown using cell-state #2,
typically offset 20 cells (or some larger multiple of 10 cells) to the right.
If any spurious objects are produced, they are shown in cell-state #3, and
removed in subsequent stages (although the removal of spurious gliders or
spaceships is left as an exercise for the reader, as such can always be
removed with a single glider). For enhanced visual effects, these may be
rendered in different colors in a Life program that can distinguish these
states, but this colorization is not otherwise necessary for proper viewing.</p>

<p>In virtually all cases, the primary syntheses show each step, although some
final syntheses shown for historical interest may omit some obvious initial
or final steps. If two mechanisms share the same initial or final steps,
those steps are only shown once.</p>

<p>A small number of extremely complicated multi-step syntheses are too large
to fit on one screen; in order to fit, these may omit an obvious stage
(such as adding or deleting a trivial still-life), or may start at an
intermediate stage, from a previously-built sophisticated object. In a few
rare cases, there may be multiple versions of synthesis (for example, the
current version, plus a less efficient older one) that are stored in
separate files, for similar size reasons.</p>

<p>For periodic objects like <a class="i" href="osc.htm">oscillators</a>,
<a class="i" href="ss.htm">spaceships</a>, and
<a class="i" href="puff.htm">puffers</a> with periods of <i>n</i>,
the <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> images are separated by a number of
generations that is a multiple of <i>n</i>, so when run, both images will
be synchronized.</p>

<p>For moving objects like <a class="i" href="ss.htm">spaceships</a>
and <a class="i" href="puff.htm">puffers</a>, the <i>after</i> image is also
usually moved back so the two ultimately appear side by side, although this
may not be done if the final result includes multiple objects of different
velocities (e.g. a spaceship and a still life). Such objects are almost always
oriented to move up, or up and left (or, in the case of oblique spaceships,
somewhere inbetween).</p>

<p>Synthesis of all 2-glider objects and some 3-glider objects were originally
found by <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#conway">Conway</a>.</p>

<p>Syntheses of most still-lifes and oscillators up to 14 bits,
most larger exotic still-lifes and oscillators, and most construction tools
(including those used to construct the pseudo-still-lifes) have been found
and/or built by <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#buckingham">Buckingham</a>.</p>

<p>Syntheses of most pseudo-still-lifes, most 15-bit still-lifes,
most other oscillators and pseudo-oscillators between 15-25 bits, and some
larger objects by <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#niemiec">Niemiec</a>.</p>

<p>Various other miscellaneous syntheses have also been found by
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm">a host of others</a>,
including (but not limited to)
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#gosper">Gosper</a>,
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#grant">Grant</a>,

<hr />
<a name="image"></a>
<h2>Image files</h2>
<p>Image files are stored in a simple compressed run-length-encoded (.RLE)
format, that is a simple text format originally designed to be easy
to encode and decode, and to facilitate sending of large Life patterns
through e-mail. This format is also read by most current Life programs.</p>

<p>On these pages, wherever possible, image files are 160x120 or smaller, but a
small number of the syntheses are slightly larger, many as large as 200x150,
several up to 320x240, and a rare few that are even larger. The large stamp
pages are slightly smaller than 640x480.</p>

<p>Most modern Life programs can directly read RLE-format files. If you do not
have access to a Life program that can read RLE-format files, you can download
an <a class="i" href="download.htm#rle2txt">RLE-to-text file converter</a> or
write your own according to the following description.</p>

<p>RLE format is described by the following rules:
<ul>
    <li>The file itself may be preceded by any number of comment lines
	beginning with a pound sign <i>#</i> (and usually the letter <i>C</i>.
	These are typically comments such as those used by the <i>Xlife</i>
	program, but the format is totally beyond the scope of this
	specification.</li>
    <li>The RLE image is prefixed by a header line, of the form
	"x = <i>i</i>, y = <i>j</i>", where <i>i</i> is the pattern width, and <i>j</i> is the
	pattern height (i.e. no cells in the following pattern will exceed these
	limits). This line must be present, and is provided for the convenience
	of Life programs that must pre-allocate memory before reading a pattern.
	(Of course, programs with dynamic memory allocation are free to ignore
	this information, but it may be used for other purposes, such as
	centering a pattern in a field after it is read).</li>
    <li>Optionally, the header may also contain a rule specification of the form
	", rule = B<i>i</i>/S<i>j</i>", where <i>i</i> is a list of zero or more birth
	conditions in the range 0-8, and <i>j</i> is a similar list of zero or more
	survival conditions. This allows representation of any totalistic
	two-state rules using a Moore neighborhood. For example, Life is B3/S23.
	Programs that do not support multiple birth and survival rules typically
	ignore this field.</li>
    <li>Some programs can support more exotic rules. For example, Golly supports
	", rule = <i>name</i>", where <i>name</i> is the name of an
	externally-supplied rule file. This is used here for files under
	<a class="i" href="rulemn.htm">Niemiec's rules</a>.</li>
    <li>The body of the RLE image consists of any number of compressed
	runs. A run consists of a single character describing the kind
	of run (optionally preceded by an integer value representing a
	repeat count, if other than 1). The character can be <i>$</i>
	representing a newline, the letter <i>b</i> representing a blank
	(empty) cell, or the letter <i>o</i> representing a living cell.</li>
    <li>Other letters may also be used to represent other kinds of
	living cells. If a Life program cannot handle multiple
	kinds of living cells, or does not recognize the particular state,
	it should default to the state used by <i>o</i> cells. The files
	in these pages often uses <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> as second and
	third colors (and, in the case of
	<a class="i" href="color.htm">multi-colored Life</a>, <i>z</i>
	as a fourth color), but this distinction is purely cosmetic - such cells
	behave just like living <i>o</i> cells. Most Life programs will display
	all these in the same color, although some use different colors for
	improved legibility.</li>
    <li>When storing multi-state patterns, Golly uses . for dead cells, and
	upper-case letters (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, etc.) for states 1, 2, etc.</li>
    <li>The RLE image is ended by an exclamation mark <i>!</i> character.</li>
    <li>For compatibility with older e-mail servers (and for
	convenience in reading these files), lines should not exceed 70
	characters. Newlines can be added as needed to accomodate this.
	To be safe, newlines should not be inserted into the middle of
	runs, although some RLE encoders will do this. Any whitespace
	(spaces, tabs, carriage returns, newlines, etc.) encountered
	within an RLE image should be ignored.</li>
    <li>The RLE files in these pages are in MS-DOS format (with newlines
	indicated by <i>CR</i> and <i>LF</i> characters), but are totally
	interoperable with Unix format (<i>LF</i> only) and old Macintosh
	format (<i>CR</i> only), since white space is ignored.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>For example, the following representation describes a glider gun:</p>
<p><pre>

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<p>Objects were originally assigned arbitrary names when they were first found.
This was adequate for small still-lifes and oscillators, but became
increasingly inadequate for larger objects, especially when different sets of
people got into the habit of using different names for the same objects.</p>

<p>Still-lifes with 9 bits and up (and some with 8 bits) have been assigned
unambiguous numbers (such as 12.121) for easy reference
(see <a class="j" href="#ordering">Ordering</a>).</p>

<p>Many objects (and all pseudo-objects) can easily be broken into two or more
distinct components, that may be combined in various different ways.
This suggests a nomenclature similar to that in organic chemistry.
Some of this nomenclature has existed in Life since the beginning
(i.e. <a class="p" href="0/8tt.rle">tub with tail (8.4)</a> and
<a class="p" href="10/10-25.rle">block on table (10.25)</a>).
Buckingham has expanded this substantially, and Niemiec has added some
additional notations as required. These definitions are by no means
universal (or necessarily even applied consistently); they are simply
an aid to describing larger objects, and appear adequate at present.</p>

<p>In these pages, the following terms are used frequently:
<ul>
    <li><b><i>a</i> on <i>b</i></b><br />
	Two objects inducting each other. One object placed immediately
	adjacent to another without touching. For asymmetric objects, this is
	used for the (arbitrarily-chosen) primary induction "site", such as
	<a class="p" href="10/10-25.rle">block on table (10.25)</a>).
	Most pseudo-objects are also formed in this way, such as
	<a class="p" href="13/13llbk1.rle">block on long shillelagh</a>.
	The primary object (typically one that has a higher period, or is
	larger, or less symmetrical) is usually specified second.
	To avoid having to specify different induction sites with additional
	adjectives, different prepositions are used. (This is adequate for
	objects in this list, but may prove increasingly inadequate for
	objects substantially larger than 20 bits in size.)</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> below <i>b</i></b><br />
	Like <i>on</i>, but specifies the induction site at right angles to
	the primary site, or 90 degrees clockwise from the primary site, such
	as <a class="p" href="13/13llbk2.rle">block below long shillelagh</a>.
	(The choice of which direction is "clockwise" is fairly arbitrary).</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> under <i>b</i></b><br />
	Like <i>below</i>, for the few objects that have a second induction
	site 90 degrees clockwise from the primary site, but further away.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> behind <i>b</i></b><br />
	Like <i>on</i>, but specifies the induction site 180 degrees clockwise
	from the primary site, such as <a class="p" href="13/13llbk3.rle">
	block behind long shillelagh</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> above <i>b</i></b><br />
	Like <i>on</i>, but specifies the induction site 270 degrees clockwise
	from the primary site, such as <a class="p" href="13/13llbk4.rle">
	block above long shillelagh</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> before <i>b</i></b><br />
	Like <i>on</i>, for the few objects that have a second induction site
	parallel to the primary site, such as
	<a class="p" href="13/13llbk5.rle">
	block before long shillelagh</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> tie <i>b</i></b><br />
	Two objects connected diagonally point-to-point, such as
	<a class="p" href="10/10-24.rle">boat tie boat (10.24)</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> bridge <i>b</i></b><br />
	Two objects connected diagonally edge-to-edge, such as
	<a class="p" href="12/12-105.rle">snake bridge snake (12.105)</a>).</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> siamese <i>b</i></b><br />
	Two objects sharing two or more bits, such as
	<a class="p" href="10/10-3.rle">loaf siamese barge (10.3)</a> or
	<a class="p" href="10/10-8.rle">snake siamese snake (10.8)</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> with <i>b</i></b> or <b><i>a</i> w/<i>b</i></b><br />
	Either one object with an attachment such as
	<a class="p" href="0/8tt.rle">tub w/ tail</a>, or an object where
	one basic component has been substituted, such as
	<a class="p" href="10/10-17.rle">integral w/ tub (10.17)</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> eating <i>b</i></b><br />
	An oscillator formed by one normally stable object eating another,
	such as <a class="p" href="14/14eet.rle">eater eating eater</a> or
	<a class="p" href="16/16cfbk1.rle">block on up candelfrobra
	(i.e. long bookend eating tub)</a>.</li>
    <li><b><i>a</i> hassling <i>b</i></b><br />
	An oscillator formed by one or more objects that either stabilize an
	unstable mechanism, or alter the period of an existing mechanism,
	such as <a class="p" href="lg/56pu2b8.rle">
	eight blocks hassling two pulsars</a>. This term is also used
	for oscillators that produce sparks that have trivial affects on another
	still-life or oscillator, such as <a class="p" href="lg/32pc2b2.rle">
	two pentadecathlons hassling two blocks</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Cis-<i>a</i></b><br />
	Like the chemical adjective, this means "on the same side", such as
	<a class="p" href="0/8cs.rle">cis snake</a>.
	It is also used for inducting objects on their sides, such as
	<a class="p" href="14/14etls7.rle">up cis python on eater</a>. When two
	objects are involved, both of that have multiple induction sites,
	typically site names qualify the larger or more complicated object,
	while <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i> qualify the simpler object. Finally,
	when combining two oscillators whose period has a GCD larger than 1,
	their phase becomes an issue. <i>Cis-</i> may refer to the primary
	phase, and <i>trans-</i> to the alternate phase. (Note that objects with
	pieces involving more than two distinct phases are beyond the scope of
	these pages, since the smallest such object has 24 bits).</li>
    <li><b>Trans-<i>a</i></b><br />
	Like the chemical adjective, this means "across from" or "on the
	opposite side", such as <a class="p" href="0/9-2.rle">extremely long
	(trans) snake (9-2)</a> (where it is normally omitted, being assumed by
	default). It is also used for inducting objects on their ends, such as
	<a class="p" href="14/14etls1.rle">up trans python on eater</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Up-<i>a</i></b><br />
	Similar to <i>cis</i>, this is refers to objects that can be
	attached in one of two ways, such as
	<a class="p" href="0/9-5.rle">up boat w/ tail (9.5)</a>.
	This also refers to objects inducting each other,
	both facing in the same direction. An object's <i>up</i> direction
	is defined in a fairly ad-hoc fashion, based on the piece of the
	object directly doing the inducting:
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Symmetrical objects</b> have no preferred direction per se,
		although they may be attached to something else that could
		define a direction.</li>
	    <li><b><a class="p" href="0/5bt.rle">Boats</a></b>,
		<b><a class="p" href="0/6sn.rle">snakes</a></b>,
		and other objects with an L tromino in the corner
		consider the corner bit <i>up</i>.</li>
	    <li><b><a class="p" href="0/7lf.rle">Loaves</a></b> and
		<b><a class="p" href="0/8cg.rle">mangos</a></b>, like
		<b><a class="p" href="0/5bt.rle">boats</a></b>, consider the
		point bit <i>down</i>. (This is different from Buckingham's
		definition, that is based on weight distribution; my
		definition is based on induction geometry, that is more
		consistent with the chemical nature of this nomenclature.)</li>
	</ul>
	These pages generally use the terms up/down to indicate direction
	parity between two objects at a bonding site, as opposed to cis/trans
	for a single object's orientation relative to a bonding sites. Other
	sites use cis/trans for both, which can sometimes cause confusion,
	especially when both kinds of distinction must be made at the same
	time.</li>
    <li><b>Down-<i>a</i></b><br />
	Similar to <i>trans</i>, this refers to objects inducting each other,
	both facing in opposite directions, opposite to <i>up</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Long-<i>a</i></b><br />
	Many objects are extendible, but usually only the smallest form is
	named, with larger versions being prefixed by <i>long</i>,
	<i>very long</i>, <i>extra long</i>, <i>extra extra long</i>, etc.
	(Beyond this, this system of nomenclature becomes less and less
	sufficient.) For example,
	<a class="p" href="0/7lb.rle">long boat</a>,
	<a class="p" href="0/7ls.rle">long snake (python)</a>,
	<a class="p" href="0/9-9.rle">tub w/ long tail</a>.
	<a class="p" href="10/10-22.rle">tub w/ very long tail (9.9)</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Short-<i>a</i></b><br />
	In some rare instances, an abnormally shortened version of an object
	that is not normally viable on its own, may exist within certain
	contexts. For example, <a class="p" href="14/14-587.rle">14.587
	(short cis hook w/ tail siamese bookend)</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Names are usually in lower-case, but upper-case is always used for proper
names of discoverers (e.g. Silver's P5) or other similar signifiers (e.g.
Gray counter, named after Gray code, in turn named after its discoverer).</p>

<hr />
<a name="ordering"></a>
<h2>Ordering</h2>
<p>Objects were originally assigned arbitrary names when they were first found.
This was adequate for small still-lifes and oscillators, but became largely
inadequate for larger objects.</p>

<p>Still-lifes with 9 bits and up (and some with 8 bits) have been assigned
unambiguous numbers (such as 12.121) for easy reference. Unfortunately, there
are several distinct versions of these numbering systems in existence.</p>

<p>These pages use <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#buckingham">Buckingham</a>'s
numbering system for still-lifes up to 14 bits (based on
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#wainwright">Wainwright</a>'s
original 8- through 10-bit lists,
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#buckingham">Buckingham</a>'s
original 11- through 13-bit lists, and his 14-bit list from
<a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#raynham">Raynham</a>'s search program).</p>

<p><a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#niemiec">Niemiec's</a> numbering system is
used for the 15- through 24- bit still-lifes. The same ordering scheme is also
used for all other objects, including those that do not have numerical names.
These are different from <a class="i" href="lifecred.htm#koenig">Koenig's</a>
numbering system.</p>

<p>In addition, the 298 <a class="i" href="p1-17.htm#p1-17-a">17-bit still-lifes</a>
whose syntheses were still unknown were assigned tentative numbers
#100&hellip;#398 during the project to synthesize them (January through May
of 2014). The <a class="i" href="lifesrch.htm">search page</a>
can search for these by name; e.g. 17#100&hellip;17#398. A similar nomenclature
16#1&hellip;16#94 has been retroactively added to the 94 difficult-to-synthesize
<a class="i" href="p1-16.htm#p1-16-a">16-bit still-lifes</a>.</p>

<p>Objects that are not actually numbered are listed in stamp pages in an
order based on their "canonical binary representation" (i.e. the same format
as used by Niemiec's
<a class="i" href="lifemeth.htm">still-life enumeration program</a>). While the exact
format is a bit too esoteric to describe here, objects are typically sorted
first by minimum population, then by period, then by bounding box height,
then by bounding box width (that is never smaller than the height). This
ordering even applies to lists that may include numbered objects. For example,
in lists like <a class="i" href="g5-p1.htm">
still-lifes that can be synthesized from five gliders</a>,
still-lifes up to 14 bits may not appear in their normal numerical sequence.</p>

<hr />
<a name="filenames"></a>
<h2>File Names</h2>
<p>The RLE files stored in these pages all use 8-character file names (for
convenient use on legacy systems like MS-DOS that don't readily support
larger file names). While such restrictions are rarely an issue any more,
the early versions of these pages were developed under MS-DOS, and it would
require a great amount of work to rename all files to more readable names.
In all cases, names contain only digits, lower-case letters, and hyphens -
and always end in ".rle".</p>

<p>Most patterns have names that begin with a number that indicates the
pattern's population, followed by a brief description of the pattern.
<a class="i" href="gun.htm">Guns</a> and
<a class="i" href="puff.htm">puffer trains</a>, since they have constantly
increasing populations, a population number is not meaningful, so it is
replaced by the letter <i>p</i> followed by the engine's base period.
Some <a class="i" href="period.htm">exotic oscillators</a> have both a number
and a period. Most unnamed <a class="i" href="exotic.htm">exotic spaceships</a>
have population followed by a velocity (e.g.
<i>d3</i> for <i>c</i>/3 diagonal,
<i>2o5</i> for 2<i>c</i>/5 orthogonal, <i>k6</i> for <i>c</i>/6 knight-ship, etc.)</p>

<p>Some specialized variant object lists add a prefix letter added, to
disambiguate names from similar objects in other lists:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><i>h</i> for
	<a class="i" href="color.htm">Hybrid, or multi-colored Life</a>.</li>
    <li><i>x</i> for the
	<a class="i" href="rule22.htm">B2/S2 rule</a>.</li>
    <li><i>t</i> for the
	<a class="i" href="rule34.htm">B34/S34 rule</a>.</li>
    <li><i>n</i> for
	<a class="i" href="rulemn.htm">Niemiec's rules</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The object description can be one of the following:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>For still-lifes from 9-21 bits, a hyphen followed by the object's
	canonical number. If the number has 6 or more digits, the hyphen is
	replaced by a leading base-36 digit (20-21 bits).</li>
    <li>For still-lifes from 22-24 bits, the same format is used as above,
	except the number is stored in hexadecimal rather than decimal.</li>
    <li>Still-lifes 25 bits and up, and all other objects are described
	symbolically, either by using their full names (if the object's name
	is short enough, and the object does not occur as parts of larger
	sub-objects), or a 2-3 character abbreviations of its name. Objects
	that defy description are often assigned arbitrary sequence numbers
	starting from 1.</li>
    <li>Complex objects show a list of abbreviations of the object's
	sub-pieces. If the pieces can be combined in multiple ways, frequently
	a sequence number is added to the end to disambiguate them. Sometimes
	if there are multiple pieces of the same type, a number is used to
	indicate multiple copies. If there are insufficient characters to
	adequately describe a complicated object, this abbreviation may be
	further mangled, sometimes unrecognizably. Note that such names are
	meant solely as mnemonic devices, and not robust descriptions of an
	object's identity.</li>
</ul></p>

<hr />
<a name="colors"></a>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>These pages make a modest use of color as a visual aid, in several
contexts.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Navigation links are colored according to their targets:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Links to other locations on the same page are in
	<span style="color:#008080;">teal</span>.</li>
    <li>Links to other pages on this site are in
	<span style="color:#000080;">blue</span>.</li>
    <li>Links to Life patterns and other downloadable files are in
	<span style="color:#008000;">green</span>.</li>
    <li>Links to other web sites are in
	<span style="color:#800000;">red</span>,
	and open in separate browser windows.</li>
    <li>Visited links are lighter in color than unvisited ones.</li>
    <li>Links about to be activated are <u>underlined</u>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Object counts</h3>
<p>In tables of <a class="i" href="objcount.htm">object counts</a>,
the background colors indicate the level of completeness of those tables:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>White (the default) indicates a list where all items are counted and
	shown, and syntheses exist (or at least have been attempted) for all.
	(<span class="h">Light blue</span> is similar, and used to make table
	structure easier to read.)</li>
    <li><span class="b">Blue</span> is like white, except syntheses for all are
	planned, but are not yet complete.</li>
    <li><span class="y">Yellow</span> indicates a list of up to 10000 items
	where all items have been counted and shown, but for which there is no
	attempt to provide syntheses for all items. Lists of more than 1000
	items show much smaller objects, with 1000 per page rather than
	100.</li>
    <li><span class="g">Green</span> is like yellow, except all items have also
	been analyzed to determine whether syntheses are possible, and trivial
	syntheses exist for most. For the few that do not have trivial
	syntheses, explicit syntheses have been developed for all (or at least
	most).</li>
    <li><span class="r">Red</span> indicates a list of items where all items
	have been counted, but are not shown. This is typically for objects with
	more than 10000 items, or for hand-generated lists that are much easier
	to enumerate than to instantiate (here, typically objects in the 22-25
	bit range).</li>
    <li><span class="o">Orange</span> is like red, except all items have also
	been analyzed to determine whether syntheses are possible, and trivial
	syntheses exist for most. For the few that do not have trivial
	syntheses, explicit syntheses have been developed for all (or at least
	most).</li>
    <li><span class="s">Grey</span> indicates a list of items where no
	definitive item lists exists, either because a computer search would
	exceed available computing resources, or there are too many items to
	count by hand.</li>
    <li><span class="v">Purple</span> is like grey, except all known item
	categories have also been analyzed to determine whether syntheses are
	possible, and trivial syntheses exist for most. For the few that do not
	have trivial syntheses, explicit syntheses have been developed for all
	(or at least most).</li>
    <li><span class="c">Teal</span> indicates an aggregate list, containing the
	sums of related lists preceding them.</li>
    <li>In all but the first two cases, these may be accompanied by smaller
	lists of selected objects for which syntheses have been found, but these
	are haphazard rather than systematic.</li>
    <li>Lists that have been verified by computer search (or smaller
	manually-generated lists of pseudo-objects based on verified lists of
	objects) are shown in <b>boldface</b>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Object lists</h3>
<p>In tables of object lists, each object shows the cost in gliders in
square brackets. These are also divided into several broad categories,
indicated by the background colors:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>White (the default) is for objects that can be synthesized using less
	than one glider per bit.</li>
    <li><span class="g">Green</span> is for objects that require exactly one
	glider per bit.</li>
    <li><span class="y">Yellow</span> is for objects that require more than
	one glider per bit.</li>
    <li><span class="r">Red</span> is for objects for which no synthesis is
	yet known, and for which a count of [x] is shown. This also includes
	objects for which a partial synthesis is known, based on a predecessor
	for which no synthesis is yet known. These show a count of [x+<i>n</i>]
	where <i>n</i> is the number of additional gliders required.</li>
    <li><span class="s">Grey</span> is for empty spots without objects.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Object stamps</h3>
<p>The object stamp-collections display a number at the top left corner of
each object, indicating its cost in gliders. These are also divided into
several broad categories, indicated by the colors of the numbers:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Teal (the default) is for objects that can be synthesized using less
	than one glider per bit.</li>
    <li>Green is for objects that require exactly one glider per bit.</li>
    <li>Yellow is for objects that require more than one glider per bit.</li>
    <li>Red is for objects for which no synthesis is yet known. This also
	includes objects for which a partial synthesis is known, based on a
	predecessor for which no synthesis is yet known.</li>
    <li>Grey is for other annotations, such as glider collisions that die
	(hence, their census can be minimally produced with zero gliders),
	or the rarity displayed with lists of
	<a class="i" href="natural.htm">common objects</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Most stamps show objects of a specific period and population. The period is
displayed in grey in the top right corner, and the population is displayed in
grey in the bottom left corner. Stamps containing moving objects (spaceships,
puffers and wick-stretchers) also display the velocity in the bottom right
corner. Stamps that contain objects of multiple periods or populations divide
these into groups using grey lines. Objects of different velocities are
similarly divided into groups separated by black lines.</p>

<p>Some categories of objects display additional information in grey.
<a class="i" href="meth.htm">methuselahs</a> show their final populations in the
bottom right corners,
while <a class="i" href="natural.htm">natural objects</a> show
their frequencies of occurrence above each object.</p>
