<P>In the rule B34568/S15678, most random patterns that I've looked at stop
growing rather quickly, ending up as polygons with horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal sides (with slopes 1 and -1); the edges have period 2 and
the corners have small periods, typically 4, 6, 8, and 10.  But several
types of infinite growth can occur, both linear (spirals and wickstretchers)
and quadratic (expanding polygons).

</P><P>Note:  Many of the patterns given here take a long time to finish (in
one case more than 10^22 generations), and you'll need a program that
implements Bill Gosper's hashlife algorithm to run them.  I recommend
"Golly", by Tomas Rokicki, Andrew Trevorrow, Dave Greene, Alan Hensel,
and Jason Summers, which can be found here:

<P>There's a structure, the 'plow', which moves along an edge of a rectangle,
increasing its size; here it's shown moving west along a northern edge:</P><PRE>

</PRE><P>The plow works in 64 rules: B356/S5678 with optional B478 and S014.  In at
least 4 of these rules (B3456/S15678 with optional B8 and S0) the plow can
turn a corner, allowing spiral growth.  Here's an example that works in all
4 of these rules:</P><PRE>

#C A plow moves counterclockwise around a square, causing it to expand
#C forever.  Population growth is linear, but every cell in the plane
#C eventually becomes and remains alive.
x = 10, y = 10, rule = B34568/S15678

</PRE><P>(There's another type of plow that works in 16 rules, B37/S345678 with
optional B8 and S012.  In these rules, a plow doesn't turn a corner,
but instead bounces back from it:</P><PRE>

#C 4 plows move back and forth along the edges of a square, causing it
#C to expand forever.  Population growth is linear, but every cell in
#C the plane eventually becomes and remains alive.

</PRE><P>Except for the plows, these rules are quite different from
B34568/S15678.)

</P><P>Here are some examples of small patterns which produce up to 12 plows:</P><PRE>

</PRE><P>Note that in the 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12-plow cases, there are 'flaws' near
some of the corners, places where the usual sawtooth edge is modified.
When a plow crosses a flaw, it's slowed down by 1 gen.  This change in
timing is necessary for an odd number of plows, and is also important
for some forms of non-spiral growth.  (Flaws aren't needed for 8 or 12
plows; they just happen to be present in these particular patterns.)

</P><P>I haven't seen more than 12 plows occur naturally, but we can construct
patterns with as many as we want.  E.g. here 32 of them make a square
grow and rotate:</P><PRE>

#C Square with 32 plows grows and slowly rotates, its sides becoming
#C asymptotically parallel to the axes.

</PRE><P>There are actually two ways that a plow can turn a corner, depending on
the phase of the corner when the plow arrives.  The resulting positions for
the plow after the turn differ by 2 units.  When two successive plows turn
a corner for the first time, the distance between them increases by either
0, 2, or 4 units.  But after the turn, the distance between them is always
congruent to 2 (mod 4), and at subsequent turns their distance increases by
either 0 or 4 units.  Furthermore, if a sequence of plows, whose successive
distances are already 2 (mod 4), turns a corner, then the increases in
distance alternate between 0 and 4.

</P><P>When we add the results of 4 corners, there are 3 possible outcomes.
Either the distances between successive plows all increase by 8, or half of
them increase by 16 while the others remain the same, or half increase by 4
while the others increase by 12:

</PRE><P>With an odd number of plows, the result of 2 complete trips around the
rectangle is an increase of 16 in all distances between successive plows,
so the plows become more and more evenly spaced around the rectangle.
With an even number N, we can either end up with N evenly spaced plows
or N/2 evenly spaced pairs of close plows, or the distances between
successive plows can be in the ratio 1 : 3 : 1 : 3 : ...  Here are
examples of all 3 possibilities:</P><PRE>

</PRE><P><H3><A name="c4">The c/4 corner</a></H3>

<P>Many examples of non-spiral growth, both linear and quadratic, involve a
corner that grows orthogonally at c/4; here 4 of them fill the plane:</P><PRE>

#C Asymptotic shape is an octagon with vertices (in gen t) at (t/4, 0),
#C (t/5, t/5), and their rotations.  Population is asymptotic to t^2/5.
#C Each of the corners along the axes grows at c/4, sending plows in
#C both perpendicular directions.  These plows meet along the lines y=x
#C and y=-x, creating the other 4 corners.
x = 5, y = 5, rule = B34568/S15678
b3o$5o$5o$5o$b3o!

</PRE><P>In the pattern below, one c/4 corner fills 1/4 of the plane, specifically
the region  -x < y < x.  But it's a bit complicated:  4/5 of the time
there are 3 c/4 corners, the large one growing to the east, and smaller
ones growing north and south.  When a northward corner meets the line
y=x, it stops growing and a horizontal edge starts growing to the east.
When that line meets the northward plows from the eastward corner, a new
northward corner forms and the process repeats.  Although the asymptotic
shape is simply a quadrilateral, two of its corners grow arbitrarily
large.</P><PRE>

#C c/4 corner fills 1/4 of the plane
#C Asymptotic shape is a convex quadrilateral, with vertices at (0,0),
#C (t/5, -t/5), (t/4, 0), and (t/5, t/5).  At the top and bottom corners,
#C the horizontal distance between the edges fluctuates between
#C 2 sqrt(t/5)  and  8/5 sqrt(t/5);  the horizontal distance fluctuates
#C between 0 and  2/5 sqrt(t/5).

</PRE><P>The northward c/4 corner can also be stopped by a flaw on the horizontal
edge, rather than by reaching the slope 1 diagonal; as the corner grows
northward, its westward plows pull the flaw northeast until the flaw
reaches the corner and stops its growth:</P><PRE>

</PRE><P>If we move both flaws 2 units farther from the southeast corner, we
increase the period by 10 and the distance that the wickstretcher grows
per period by 2, increasing the speed to 52c/266.  (If we move just
the east-edge flaw 2 units north, then the pattern still grows diagonally
until about gen 5840, at which point the last plows on both edges reach
the corner too close together; the pattern stops growing in gen 10556.)

</P><P>We can also move both flaws closer to the corner to decrease the period
and speed; in this way we obtain wickstretchers of speed  2nc/(10n+6)
for all  n >= 4.  We can also adjust the relative timing of the south and
east edges; each must follow the other by  23+10k  gens for some  k >= 0.
And by changing the lengths of the edges west and north of the flaws, we
can make such wickstretchers arbitrarily wide.

</P><P>Here are examples of the different timings of wickstretchers with n
from 0 to 5.  In these, the flaws have been replaced by the diagonal
edges, to give examples with minimum width (I think).</P><PRE>

<P><H3><A name="poly">Polygonal growth</a></H3>

<P>In all of the diagonal wickstretchers, the growing corner sends plows
in two directions; these plows hit diagonal edges and stop.  But if two
such corners are growing perpendicular to each other, their plows can
travel until they meet each other; in this way we can obtain quadratic
growth.  For example, here a 5c/19 corner and an 8c/46 corner fill a
quarter-plane:

</PRE><P>For two corners to be compatible in this way, their speeds s and t must
satisfy  t >= s/(1+2s)  and  s >= t/(1+2t);  otherwise one corner's plows
will catch up with and destroy the other corner.  These inequalities are
satisfied by all pairs of the speeds mentioned so far, so we can combine
any 2, 3, or 4 of them to fill 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, or all of the plane.  Here's

<P><H3><A name="c8">The c/8 corner</a></H3>

<P>There's one other common form of diagonal growth, which doesn't seem to
exist as a wickstretcher; its speed is c/8.  It also produces plows, but
with a different leading edge that can't turn a corner or hit a diagonal
line cleanly.  Here it's shown filling the first quadrant:
</P><PRE>

#C c/8 corner grows northeast.  Asymptotic shape is a quadrilateral with
#C vertices (0,0), (t/9, 0), (t/8, t/8), and (0,t/9).  Population is
#C asymptotic to t^2/72.  (This is the slowest form of quadratic growth
#C that I know of.)
x = 5, y = 5, rule = B34568/S15678
ob3o$2o$2obo$2o$b3o!

</PRE><P>The most common form of infinite growth has 4 of the c/8 corners:
</P><PRE>

#C Asymptotic shape is concave octagon whose vertices in gen t are at
#C (t/9, 0), (t/8, t/8), and their rotations.  Population in gen t is
#C asymptotic to 1/18 t^2.
x = 5, y = 5, rule = B34568/S15678
obobo$o2b2o$2o2bo$2bobo$5o!

</PRE><P>In this example all 4 corners start their c/8 growth within 300 gens.
But often it takes much longer.  E.g. here one corner starts growing in
gen 630 and the others about gens 9000, 22000, and 61000:
</P><PRE>

x = 6, y = 5, rule = B34568/S15678
o2b2o$ob3o$o4bo$2bo2bo$o2bobo!

</PRE><P>If the inequalities stated earlier applied to the c/8 corner, it would only
be compatible with perpendicular corners with speeds between c/10 and c/6,
slower than the others mentioned so far.  But when the modified plows
from the c/8 meet the normal ones from faster corners, the collisions
produce flaws which slow down the normal plows.  So in fact the c/8 corner
is compatible with the 8c/46, 10c/56, 12c/66, and 14c/76 corners.  In the
last 3 cases, the collision point between the plows stays a bounded
distance from the c/8 corner, so the asymptotic shapes are quadrilaterals
rather than pentagons.  This seems like an odd coincidence, and I don't
know if there's a good explanation for it.  (It's conceivable that the
slope of the top edge adjacent to the  2nc/(10n+6)  corner could depend
on initial conditions, and that some such corner is compatible with the
c/8 corner for some  n > 7,  but I haven't seen any evidence of that.)

<P><H3><A name="strange">Some stranger patterns</a></H3>

<P>So far all of the patterns that I've mentioned have asymptotic shapes
that are polygons, and each edge is spatially periodic.  I don't know
if nonpolygonal asymptotic shapes can occur, but there are some
patterns whose edges aren't periodic, and others which don't have an
asymptotic shape.  The ones that I know of are based on the
flaw-pulling interaction of two c/4 corners.

</P><P>First, here's a pattern whose asymptotic shape is a hexagon, but two
of its edges are not periodic.  The top edge (with slope 1/6) is made
up of ever-lengthening straight pieces of slopes 0 and 1/4, and the
left edge is similarly jagged.</P><PRE>

#C Asymptotic shape is convex hexagon with vertices at (t/5, -t/5),
#C (t/4, 0), (t/5, t/5), (-t/7, t/7), (-t/5, -t/5), (0, -t/4). The
#C top and left edges (with slopes 1/6 and 6) are not spatially
#C periodic.

</PRE><P>Most patterns in this rule run quite efficiently in hashlife.  However,
whenever an edge with slope 1/6 forms, the program slows things down
enormously and uses a lot of memory.  Several times my computer has
crashed when using Golly to run such things.  (I understand that that's
because I have such an out-of-date computer; on newer ones Golly will
slow down but shouldn't crash.)

</P><P>This pattern has no asymptotic shape:</P><PRE>

#C No asymptotic shape
#C Pattern is approximately square, symmetric under 90 degree rotation,
#C and usually has 2 hills with slopes 1/4 and -1/4 along the north

<P><H3><A name="spurt 5c19">Growth spurts (5c/19 plus c/8)</a></H3>

<P>If a pattern has growing corners of speeds  5c/19  or  2nc/(10n+6)  in
opposite directions, it will probably settle down to a wickstretcher,
possibly a 2-ended one.  For example:</P><PRE>

#C About gen 4200 this becomes a 2-ended wickstretcher growing at 5c/19
#C southwest and 8c/46 northeast.

2obobo$2bo2bo$2b2o$2bob2o$2o2bo!

</PRE><P>But if one corner has speed c/8, then things can get more interesting,
as in this pattern:

</P><PRE>x = 5, y = 5, rule = B34568/S15678
5o$2ob2o$2obo$2o2bo$4o!

</PRE><P>Starting around gen 800, this grows at 5c/19 southwest, and at c/8 in
the other 3 diagonal directions.  The plows from the 5c/19 corner
reach the adjacent corners around gen 2200, stopping them.  After that,
the southwest part grows as a wide 5c/19 wickstretcher.

</P><P>In gen 2672 the half of the pattern above the SW-NE diagonal has 3 edges,
with slopes 24/5, 1, and 1/9.  But then the modified plows from the
northeast c/8 corner reach the edge of slope 1, and 3 new edges appear,
with slopes 2, 1/8, and -4/19.  During gens 2672 to 5197 the top half
of the pattern grows, changing shape several times; the table below
shows the slopes of the edges, from bottom to top, during the process.

an edge appears or disappears.)

occur in the bottom half of the pattern, starting at gens 2770, 5240,
14430, and 48317.

</P><P>If all growth spurts were of the same type, such patterns would grow
forever, with no asymptotic shape, and would expand by a factor
asymptotic to 415/112 = 3.705... during each spurt.  But variations
sometimes occur.  For this pattern the last spurt in the lower half is
different:  Gen 88710 corresponds to gen 3470 above, but instead of
a vertical edge starting to form immediately, it's delayed until

</PRE><P>Because of the delay, the slope -19/4 edge catches up with the
c/8 corner, stopping it about gen 153850.  The pattern takes until
gen 355901 to settle down, becoming a 5c/19 diagonal wickstretcher
with width about 130000.

</P><P>I've seen many examples of patterns like this, combining 5c/19 and
c/8 corners.  In each case, after some number of growth spurts, the
c/8 corner gets stopped and the pattern becomes a 5c/19 wickstretcher.
Since most spurts take about 3.7 times as long as the preceding ones,
it doesn't take very many of them to make a pattern last for a long
time.  Here's the longest-lasting one that I've seen:</P><PRE>

#C Becomes a 5c/19 diagonal wickstretcher about gen 5.88205*10^15, with
#C width about 2.2*10^15.  This goes through 22 growth spurts on each
#C side of the diagonal, before the last one on the bottom stops the
#C c/8 corner about gen 2.5*10^15.

</PRE><P>I don't know if all such patterns always behave this way, or if there
are some in which infinitely many growth spurts occur.  With enough
work, we could probably model this as a "3n+1" type of problem, and
find patterns that last much longer than the ones I've seen.

<P>Although they're much less common, there are also some patterns
which combine a  2nc/(10n+6)  corner and a c/8 corner.  (Sometimes
there are two c/8 corners if n <= 7).  These also undergo growth
spurts like those above, although variant types seem to be more
common.  Some of the variants produce c/4 corners which eventually
stop both of the diagonal corners.  So instead of turning into a
wide wickstretcher, these often stop growing completely.  Here are

bob3o$2bob3o$b2obobo$bobo$4obo!

</PRE><P>I don't know exactly what this pattern does.  Like the c/8 corner, some
of the plows that the corner produces are unusual, and it doesn't seem
to work as a wickstretcher.  At times up to 3.4*10^9, the pattern's
shape is usually a pentagon:</P><PRE>

___ A
B  ___---   |
  |         |
  |         |
  |        |
C |        |
   \      |
    \_____|
    D      E

</PRE><P>At A it grows at 25c/150 to the northeast, sending plows west and south
which form the edges AB and AE (with slopes 1/7 and 7).  There are messy
reactions at B and E, which sometimes send plows south and west, moving
the edges BC and DE west and south.  Usually when the plows reach C and D,
they just extend the edge CD without moving it sideways.  But on rare
occasions a modified plow causes a messy reaction at C or D, moving the
edge southwest.

</P><P>Growth to the south and west seems to be sublinear; at gen 3.4*10^9 these
edges have only moved about 528000 and 594000 units, respectively.  If
the pattern continues in this way, then the asymptotic shape is the quadrilateral with vertices (0,0), (t/7, 0), (t/6, t/6), and (0,t/7).
But it's possible that some more complex reaction will occur somewhere
which will change things completely.  E.g. if a 5c/19 corner were to
form at B or E, its plows would eventually reach corner A, stopping the
25c/150 growth.

</P><P>Putting two 25c/150 corners together seems to give more orderly growth.
But I haven't determined exactly when southward growth occurs, and I
can't guarantee that this will run forever either:</P><PRE>
