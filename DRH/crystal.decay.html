Two versions of an extensible oscillator in which glider alternately
form and destroy a crystal.

#N Crystal&decay 2700
#C A p150 gun fires at a pair of pentadecathlons.  When the first glider
#C hits the PDs, it is reflected back and hits the second, forming a
#C honey farm.  Subsequent gliders form a crystal growing upstream.  When
#C the crystal reaches an eater near the gun, it begins to decay.
#C When it's all gone, the cycle begins again.
#C The period of this pattern is 2700, but by moving the PDs, any period
#C of the form  750 + 1950n  (n>=0)  can be obtained.
