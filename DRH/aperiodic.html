#N Exponential aperiodic pattern
#C A p20 puffer moves east, sending gliders southwest.  Another glider
#C bounces back and forth between the line of gliders and a stationary
#C reflector (found by Mark Niemiec).  The round trip time of the
#C bouncing glider triples each time, so cells along its path never
#C become periodic; the intervals between successive passes of the
#C glider grow exponentially.
#C This is based on an earlier pattern in which a glider bounced
#C between the outputs of two puffers; replacing one by a stationary
#C reflector decreased the size of the pattern.

#N Linear aperiodic pattern
#C A glider bounces back and forth between a fixed reflector and a
#C diagonal line of boats produced by 2 glider puffers.  Each round
#C trip takes 120 gens longer than the preceding one, so cells along
#C the path never become periodic.
